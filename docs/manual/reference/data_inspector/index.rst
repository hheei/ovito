The data inspector is a panel located below the viewport area, providing a comprehensive view of the data
loaded from the input file and/or dynamically computed by the data pipeline. The data inspector panel is initially
in a collapsed state, with only the tab bar visible. It can be expanded by clicking anywhere in the tab bar.
The panel consists of several pages, each being dynamically shown depending on the kinds of
data that are present in the current dataset. For example, there is a page
listing all particles and their property data in tabular form.

The following pages are part of the data inspector and are shown only if the corresponding type
of data is present in the pipeline output:

* :ref:`data_inspector.particles`
* :ref:`data_inspector.bonds`
* Angles
* Dihedrals
* Impropers
* :ref:`data_inspector.types`
* :ref:`data_inspector.simulation_cell`
* :ref:`data_inspector.attributes`
* :ref:`data_inspector.data_tables`
* :ref:`data_inspector.voxel_grids`
* Surfaces
* :ref:`data_inspector.dislocations`

One additional page, :ref:`data_inspector.coding_agent`, is always shown, since it is independent of the
data loaded into the current dataset.
