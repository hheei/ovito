Standard renderer
=================

.. image:: /images/rendering/standard_renderer_panel.*
  :width: 30%
  :align: right

This is the default built-in :ref:`rendering engine <usage.rendering>`,
which is also used by OVITO for rendering the interactive viewports.

The "More Options" (vertical ellipsis) button next to each numerical parameter opens a context menu with
the option to reset each parameter to its default value.

Parameters
""""""""""

Anti-aliasing level
  To reduce `aliasing effects <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing>`__, the output image is usually rendered at a higher resolution
  than the final image (*supersampling*). This factor controls how much larger this
  resolution is. A factor of 1 turns anti-aliasing off. Higher values lead to better quality.

Transparency rendering method
  This option controls how the effect of two or more semi-transparent scene objects overlapping with each other should be computed by the renderer.
  Both available methods represent different approximations of how a true rendition of
  semi-transparent objects would look like - which is not achievable in real-time visualization using rasterization techniques.

  Back-to-front ordered rendering (default) gives correct results if there is only one kind of semi-transparent object in the scene,
  e.g. just particles, but likely fails to render a mixture of different semi-transparent objects correctly, e.g. semi-transparent
  particles combined with semi-transparent :ref:`surface meshes <visual_elements.surface_mesh>`.

  `Weighted Blended Order-Independent Transparency <https://jcgt.org/published/0002/02/09/>`__ is an alternative method more suitable
  for overlapping semi-transparent objects of different kinds. But it can deliver only a rough approximation of translucency.
