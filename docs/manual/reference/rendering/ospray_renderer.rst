OSPRay renderer |ovito-pro|
===========================

OSPRay is a software-based ray-tracing engine, which can generate high-fidelity scene renderings including
global illumination effects, shadows and depth of field (focal blur). The OSPRay renderer has a smaller memory footprint than
the :ref:`Tachyon renderer <rendering.tachyon_renderer>`. It is thus suitable for rendering very large datasets
with higher visual quality than the :ref:`rendering.standard_renderer`.

For more information on the capabilities of the OSPRay engine and its technical background,
please visit the website https://www.ospray.org.
The OSPRay documentation contains more in-depth information on this rendering engine's various parameters.

The "More Options" (vertical ellipsis) button next to each numerical parameter opens a context menu with
the option to reset each parameter to its default value.

Quality settings
""""""""""""""""

Refinement passes
  OSPRay uses a progressive rendering method, which further refines the generated image during each rendering pass.
  This parameter controls the number of refinement iterations to compute (default value: 4).

Samples per pixel
  The number of ray-tracing samples computed per pixel (default value: 8).
  Larger values can help reduce aliasing artifacts and will yield better results, especially if the *depth of field*
  option is turned on.

Ray recursion depth
  The maximum number of recursion steps taken during ray-tracing (default value: 10).
  Normally, 1 or 2 is enough, but when rendering many overlapping semi-transparent objects, a larger recursion depth may be needed.

Roulette depth
  Ray recursion depth at which to start Russian roulette termination (default value: 5).

Denoising filter
  Applies a denoising filter to the rendered image to reduce Monte Carlo noise inherent to stochastic
  methods such as path tracing.

Depth of field
  When `depth-of-field rendering <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field>`__ is active, only objects located exactly at the distance from the camera specified by the *focal length* will appear sharp.
  Objects closer to or farther from the camera will appear blurred. To focus on a specific object, use the :guilabel:`Pick in viewport` button
  and click on the desired object in the viewport to be rendered. The *focal length* parameter will be automatically adjusted so that the picked location is in focus.
  The *aperture* radius controls how blurred out-of-focus objects will appear (default: 0.5).

  Note that the focal blur effect requires a perspective projection; it does not work in :ref:`viewports <usage.viewports>` using a parallel projection.

Light sources
"""""""""""""

Direct light
  Enables a directional light source positioned behind the camera and pointing roughly along the viewing direction.
  The *angular diameter* specifies the apparent size (angle in degrees) of the light source.
  Setting the angular diameter to a value greater than zero yields soft shadows. For instance, the apparent size
  of the sun is about 0.53°.

Ambient light
  The ambient light surrounds the entire scene and illuminates it from infinity with constant radiance.

Sun-sky light
  The sun-sky light produces the light typically coming from the sky and the sun in an outdoor scene.
  The radiance values are calculated using the Hošek-Wilkie sky model and solar radiance function.
  The zenith of the sky as well as the sun are positioned along the positive Z axis of the scene and are independent of the camera orientation.

Material type
"""""""""""""

The OSPRay renderer supports two material types: *Standard* and *Principled*.
These correspond to the *OBJ* and *Principled* materials described in the `documentation of OSPRay <https://www.ospray.org/documentation.html#materials>`__,
respectively.

The selected material type and its settings are applied globally to all scene objects.

  Standard material

Standard material
#################

The *Standard* material type is based on the Phong reflection model, which is suitable for many purposes.
It supports specular highlights, controlled by the following parameters:

Specular brightness
  The specular reflectivity of the material (default value: 2%).

Shininess
  Specular Phong exponent, which is usually in the range between 2.0 and 10000.0 (default value: 10.0).

Principled material
###################

The *Principled* material type can reproduce a wide variety of materials, e.g. plastic, metal, and glass.
It consists of a mixture of a metallic and a dielectric/diffuse material model. The relative contribution of these models is
controlled using the *metalness* parameter.

The table below shows how the *Principled* material behaves for different parameter settings.
The `Blender wiki <https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/shader/principled.html>`__ also offers
a good visual overview of the various parameters of the *Principled* material and how they affect the appearance.

============================= ============================= =============================

Roughness
  Controls the variation of microfacets and thus how polished the metal looks (default value: 30%).
  A value of 0% gives a perfectly polished mirror surface, while a value of 100% gives a completely rough surface.

Metalness
  Gradually switches from a dielectric/diffuse material to a metallic material (default value: 10%).

Specular brightness
  Controls the specular reflectivity of the dielectric/diffuse component of the material (default value: 80%).

Index of refraction
  Controls the index of refraction (IoR) for specular reflection. For most materials, the IoR is between 1.0 (air) and 4.0 (germanium). Default value: 1.0
