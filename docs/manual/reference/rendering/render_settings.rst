Render settings
===============

.. image:: /images/rendering/render_settings_panel.*
  :width: 35%
  :align: right

This panel contains general settings related to :ref:`image and movie rendering <usage.rendering>`,
e.g. resolution, output filename, background color, etc.
It is found on the :guilabel:`Rendering` tab of the command panel as depicted in the screenshot.

To start an image/movie rendering process, use the :guilabel:`Render active viewport`
button located at the bottom of the panel or the button in the toolbar located above the viewports. OVITO will always render the currently
active viewport, which is indicated by a yellow border. Right-click in a viewport to make it the active one.

By default, rendered images are displayed in the so-called frame buffer window after rendering is complete, but they are not automatically saved to disk.
That means they will be lost as soon as you close the frame buffer window or quit OVITO. To save rendered images, you can either use the :guilabel:`Save to file` function
found in the toolbar of the frame buffer window after rendering is complete or activate the :guilabel:`Save to file` option in advance in the
*Render settings* panel, which is described below.

When rendering a movie note that the total length of the animation and the playback speed (frames per second) are set in
the :ref:`animation settings dialog <animation.animation_settings_dialog>`, which can be opened
using the :guilabel:`Animation settings` button.

Parameters
""""""""""

Rendering range
  Selects which animation frame(s) to render.
  If you decide to render an animation, i.e. a range of frames,
  make sure you also check the :guilabel:`Save to file` option and set an output filename below.
  Otherwise, the rendered animation will not get permanently saved to disk.

Every Nth frame
  This value determines which fraction of animation frames is actually rendered.
  Setting this parameter to 1 renders every animation frame. A value of 2 will render only every other frame, etc.
  Thus, you can use this to reduce the number of generated video frames in case of extremely long simulation sequences.

File number base
  When saving the frames of the animation as a series of image files (rather than a single movie file),
  OVITO automatically appends the frame number to the output filename. This setting lets you specify another base file number,
  i.e. an offset. This can be useful if you want to collect the video frames from several animation sequences
  in one directory and later combine them into one contiguous movie using an external video encoding software.

Output image size
  Sets the width and height of the rendered image or movie in pixels.
  Note that you can activate the :ref:`preview mode <usage.viewports.menu>` for an interactive viewport window to
  see exactly which rectangular area of the viewport will be visible in the final output image.

Preview visible region
  This option activates preview mode for the current viewport window, which means it will display a rectangular
  frame indicating the area that will be visible in the rendered output image.
  The aspect ratio of the rectangular guide is determined by the output image width and height.

Render all viewports |ovito-pro|
  Activate this option to generate a composed output image with multiple side-by-side views of your 3d scene.
  The arrangement of the views is determined by the current :ref:`layout of the interactive viewport windows <viewport_layouts>`.
  Note that you can modify the number, size and layout of the viewports by dragging the vertical and horizontal lines separating
  the viewport windows.

Save to file
  This option tells OVITO to save the rendered image or movie to disk in addition to displaying it
  in the frame buffer window. Use the :guilabel:`Choose...` button to pick an output filename.
  When rendering an animation sequence, all animation frames will be written to a single movie
  file if you pick a video format such as AVI or MPEG (see :ref:`application_settings.video_encoding`). If you choose an image format (e.g. PNG, JPEG),
  OVITO will instead produce a sequence of image files, one per frame. In this case, the frame number will
  automatically be appended to the base filename you provide. Alternatively, if the filename contains a "*"
  wildcard character, it will be replaced by the frame number.

Background
  You can choose between a uniform background color and a transparent background.
  In the latter case, OVITO will make those areas of the output image
  transparent that are not covered by any objects. This is useful if you intend to
  put the image in front of some other background later, for instance on a presentation slide.
  Note that transparency information (*alpha channel*) must be
  supported by the output format for this to work. Best choice is the PNG file format.

Switch renderer
  Use this button to select a different rendering engine. OVITO Pro offers
  several rendering engines, which differ in terms of visual quality and rendering speed.
  See the :ref:`Rendering <rendering>` page for a list of options.
  Each rendering engine has specific parameters and settings, which are displayed in the separate
  panel below the *Render settings* panel.

Post-processing effects
"""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/rendering/postprocessing_effects_panel.png
  :width: 35%
  :align: right

These effects are applied to the rendered image by all rendering engines alike. Because they are
not specific to any one rendering engine, they are configured here and are preserved when you
switch to a different engine.

Outlines
  Enables the drawing of outlines along object edges. The outlines are *depth-aware*,
  meaning that they are only drawn when the depth difference between two overlapping objects
  exceeds a certain threshold. Optionally, the width of the outlines can be adjusted
  based on the depth difference, which can help to improve visibility of outlines in complex scenes.

    Outlines in the interactive viewport.

  .. figure:: /images/rendering/visrtx_render_outlines.*
    :figwidth: 49%

    Outlines in the rendered image.

  Depth Difference & Outline Width
    Uniform Width Mode
      In this mode, a single value is used for both the depth difference and the outline width.
      An outline with a constant width is drawn around all objects that have a depth difference
      greater than the specified value relative to the background.

    Variable Width Mode
      In this mode, the outline width increases linearly from the minimum to the maximum width
      as the depth difference between overlapping objects varies from the minimum to the maximum depth difference.
      When switching from *Uniform Width Mode* to *Variable Width Mode*, any missing values for
      depth or line width will be automatically set to their default values.

  Custom Color
    When disabled, the outline color is automatically determined based on the background color:
    white outlines for dark backgrounds and black outlines for light backgrounds.
    When enabled, the manually selected color is used instead.
