Please cite this paper when you use this structure identification algorithm for diamond lattices in your work.
A preprint is available `here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06597>`__.

The algorithm analyzes the local environment of each atom up to the second neighbor shell to determine the local structural type.
The results are stored in the ``Structure Type`` particle property, with the type assigned to each atom encoded as an integer value:

The option :guilabel:`Use only selected particles` restricts the analysis to the
currently selected atoms. If this option is activated, unselected atoms will be ignored
(as if they did not exist) and will be assigned the structure type "Other".
This option can be useful if you want to identify defects in a crystal with a non-diamond structure,
but which has a sublattice that is a diamond lattice
(and you do not want to delete atoms belonging to the other sublattice(s) for some reason).

How it works
""""""""""""

To classify a central atom, this structure identification method takes into account second nearest neighbors to
discriminate between cubic and hexagonal diamond structures. The method can be considered
an extended version of the popular :ref:`Common Neighbor Analysis (CNA) <particles.modifiers.common_neighbor_analysis>`, which is typically used to identify FCC, HCP, or BCC structures.
However, the conventional CNA is not suited for diamond structures, because nearest neighbor atoms don't have common neighbors,
and the second and third nearest neighbor shells are not well separated.

  Central atom (green), nearest neighbors (blue), and neighbors of neighbors (yellow):

  FCC

  :figwidth: 20%

  HCP

These problems are solved as follows: First, the nearest neighbors of an atom are identified. Then, for each of these four neighbors, their respective nearest neighbors are identified.
This yields the list of second nearest neighbors of the central atom.
Finally, the CNA fingerprint is computed for these 12 second nearest neighbors and the central atom.
If they are arranged on an FCC lattice, then the central atom is classified as
cubic diamond. If they form a HCP structure, then the central atom is marked as a hexagonal diamond atom.
