Compute property
----------------

.. image:: /images/modifiers/compute_property_panel.png

The *Compute Property* modifier sets property values of particles, bonds, and other elements according to a user-defined mathematical formula.
It can also be used to create new :ref:`user-defined properties <usage.particle_properties>`.

The math expression for computing the value for each element can reference existing per-particle or per-bond data, as well as
global parameters such as the simulation box dimensions or the current animation time. A list of available input variables is
provided in the modifier's user interface. Additionally, the *Compute Property* modifier supports computations involving neighboring particles
within a defined spherical volume around each particle or which are bonded to the central particle.

The output property
"""""""""""""""""""

As explained in the :ref:`introduction on particle properties <usage.particle_properties>`, certain properties, such as ``Color`` or ``Radius``,
have special significance within OVITO because they control the visual appearance of individual particles and bonds. Modifying these properties using
the *Compute Property* modifier directly impacts visualization.

For example, you can:

  - Modify the ``Position`` property to move particles.
  - Assign new values to the ``Color`` property to recolor particles dynamically.
  - Modify the ``Selection`` property, creating a selection set like the :ref:`particles.modifiers.expression_select` modifier, but with greater flexibility.

Additionally, you can create entirely new properties and use them in subsequent operations within the data pipeline or export them to an output file.
To do so, simply enter a custom property name in the :guilabel:`Output property` field. Note that property names in OVITO are case-sensitive.
Standard property names predefined by the software are available in the drop-down list.

  - :ref:`List of standard particle properties <particle-properties-list>`
  - :ref:`List of standard bond properties <bond-properties-list>`
  - :ref:`List of standard voxel grid properties <voxelgrid-properties-list>`
  - :ref:`List of standard line properties <lines-properties-list>`
  - :ref:`List of standard vector properties <vectors-properties-list>`

.. _particles.modifiers.compute_property.vector_properties:

Vectorial properties
""""""""""""""""""""

Some particle properties, such as ``Position`` and ``Color``, consist of multiple components (XYZ and RGB).
When computing such vector properties, you need to specify a separate scalar expression for each component.

Since OVITO 3.12.1, the modifier also supports the creation of user-defined vector properties.
To define a custom vector property, simply enter the names of the vector components into the :guilabel:`Components` field
as a comma-separated list, e.g. "X, Y, Z" and press :kbd:`Enter`. The GUI panel will then dynamically display a corresponding number of
input fields for you to specify an expression for each component.

Selective assignment
""""""""""""""""""""

If the specified output property already exists, the modifier overwrites it with the newly computed values.
However, by enabling the :guilabel:`Compute only for selected` option, you can restrict property assignment to a
subset of particles or bonds, preserving existing values for currently unselected elements.

Conditional values
""""""""""""""""""

You can also use conditional logic within expressions using the ternary operator ``? :``. This allows for simple *if-else* conditions.

For example, to make the particles in the upper half of the simulation box :ref:`semi-transparent <howto.transparent_particles>` while keeping those in the lower half fully opaque,
use the following expression to set the ``Transparency`` property of all particles:

.. code-block:: none

  (ReducedPosition.Z > 0.5) ? 0.7 : 0.0

For more complex computations that cannot be performed using conditional expressions like this,
consider using a :ref:`particles.modifiers.python_script` modifier, which allows scripting in a real programming language.

.. _particles.modifiers.compute_property.neighbor_expr:

Performing computations over neighbors and bonded particles
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The *Compute Property* modifier supports computations that involve the local neighborhood of particles.

The final output value for the :math:`i`-th particle is computed as a sum of two terms: a base expression, :math:`F(i)`, that is evaluated for the central particle :math:`i`,
and a second term, :math:`G(i,j)`, that is evaluated for each neighboring (or connected) particle :math:`j`:

  :math:`P(i) = F(i) + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}_i}{G(i,j)}`

.. image:: /images/modifiers/compute_property_neighbor_expr.*
  :width: 30%
  :align: right

The expressions for :math:`F(i)` and :math:`G(i,j)` must be entered separately in the user interface of the modifier.

The set of visited neighbors, :math:`\mathcal{N}_i`, may be defined in two ways:

  - By specifying a cutoff radius, :math:`R_c`, around each particle, within which neighboring particles are considered:

      :math:`\mathcal{N}_i = {j: |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j| < R_c}`,

  - By using the bonds between particles. The neighbor term will then be evaluated for each particle that has a bond to the current central particle.

The neighbor term :math:`G(i,j)` may depend on property values of the current neighbor :math:`j`, the central particle :math:`i`,
and the vector connecting the two particles.

**Example: Smoothing a property over neighboring particles**

The neighbor expression allows you to perform advanced computations that involve the local neighborhood of particles. For example, you
can smooth an existing particle property (e.g. ``InputProperty``) by averaging its value over a particle's local neighborhood:

.. code-block:: none

  F(i)   := InputProperty / (NumNeighbors+1)
  G(i,j) := InputProperty / (NumNeighbors+1)

``NumNeighbors`` is a dynamic variable yielding the current number of neighboring particles within the selected cutoff radius, ensuring proper normalization.

**Example: Lennard-Jones potential calculation**

The following expressions compute the potential energy of each particle using a Lennard-Jones function:

.. code-block:: none

  F(i)   := 0
  G(i,j) := 4 * (Distance^-12 - Distance^-6)

The dynamic variable ``Distance`` in the :math:`G(i,j)` expression yields the current separation between the central particle and its neighbor.

**Example: Counting neighbor particles of a certain type**

The :math:`G(i,j)` expression may refer to property values of the central particle :math:`i` by prepending
the ``@`` prefix to a property name. For instance, the following expressions count the neighbors whose types are
different from the type of the central particle:

.. code-block:: none

  F(i)   := 0
  G(i,j) := (ParticleType != @ParticleType)

Note that the operator ``!=`` evaluates to 1 if the type of particle :math:`j` is not equal to the type of particle :math:`i`, and 0 otherwise.

Computations on bonds
"""""""""""""""""""""

The modifier can also operate on bonds instead of particles. Then it will compute a new property for each pair-wise bond in the system.

If :guilabel:`Operate on` is set to *Bonds*, expression variables refer to existing per-bond properties.
You can also include properties of the two connected particles by prefixing their property names with ``@1.`` or ``@2.``.

For example, to select all bonds that connect different particle types and have a length greater than 2.8,
you can set the output bond property to ``Selection`` and use the following expression:

.. code-block:: none

  @1.ParticleType != @2.ParticleType && BondLength > 2.8

Since bond orientation is arbitrary, ``@1.`` and ``@2.`` may refer to either connected particle.
Thus, to explicitly select bonds between type-1 and type-2 particles, a more complex expression is necessary
to account for the two possibilities:

.. code-block:: none

  (@1.ParticleType == 1 && @2.ParticleType == 2) || (@1.ParticleType == 2 && @2.ParticleType == 1)

Expression syntax
"""""""""""""""""

The modifier's expression syntax resembles that of the C programming language.
Variable names and function names are case-sensitive.

.. attention::

  Spaces in property names are simply left out in the corresponding variable names. For example, the particle property *Particle Type* is accessible as the variable
  ``ParticleType`` in the expression. Other invalid characters in property names are replaced by underscores in the variable names.

Operators are evaluated in the following order of precedence:

.. table::
  :widths: auto

  ======================================================== ========================================================================================
  Operator                                                 Description

  ``A || B``                                               Logical OR: True if *A*, *B*, or both are non-zero
  ``A ? B : C``                                            Conditional (ternary) operator: If *A* differs from 0, yields *B*, else *C*

Type names in expressions
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 3.12.0

Particle types and bond types are represented by unique numeric identifiers in OVITO, i.e., the ``ParticleType`` variable evaluates to an integer value
uniquely identifying the type of the current particle. The same applies to other :ref:`typed properties <scene_objects.particle_types>`
in OVITO such as the *Structure Type* property.

Each type may have a human-readable name associated with it, e.g., the numeric type 1 may be named *"Cu"*.
You can use these type names in expressions, e.g., ``ParticleType == "Cu"``, where the type name is enclosed in double quotes.
Type names can also be matched against a regular expression using the ``=~`` operator, e.g., ``ParticleType =~ /^(Cu|Fe)$/``.

For further information on the use of type names in expressions, see :ref:`here <particles.modifiers.expression_select.type_names>`.

String properties in expressions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 3.16.0

Properties of *string* data type, e.g. the `Atom Name` property read from molecular structure files, can be used in expressions with
equality (``==``) and inequality (``!=``) comparisons, and regular expression matching (``=~``).
The comparison works with string literals or other string properties; regex patterns use the Perl-style ``/pattern/`` or ``/pattern/i``
(case-insensitive) syntax. For full documentation and examples, see :ref:`here <particles.modifiers.expression_select.string_properties>`.

.. attention::

  While existing string properties can be referenced in expressions, the *Compute Property* modifier cannot be used to assign or newly create string properties, as the expression must evaluate to a numeric value.
  However, you can use the :ref:`particles.modifiers.python_script` modifier to assign new string properties to particles.

Additional examples
"""""""""""""""""""

**Example: Computing particle speed**

To compute the linear velocity (speed) of each particle based on the components :math:`(v_x, v_y, v_z)` of its velocity
vector, you can use the following expression:

.. code-block:: none

  sqrt(Velocity.X^2 + Velocity.Y^2 + Velocity.Z^2)
