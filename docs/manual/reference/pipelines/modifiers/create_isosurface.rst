  Two isosurfaces of the charge density field

This modifier computes an `isosurface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosurface>`__ for a field defined on a structured
:ref:`voxel grid <scene_objects.voxel_grid>`.
The resulting isosurface is a :ref:`surface mesh <scene_objects.surface_mesh>` object and
its visual appearance is controlled by the accompanying :ref:`surface mesh <visual_elements.surface_mesh>` visual element.

You can change the iso-level value by clicking on the histogram plot, which shows the distribution of field values.
To create multiple isosurfaces at different iso-levels, you can insert several instances of the modifier into the pipeline.

Voxel grids can be imported into OVITO from several :ref:`input file formats <file_formats.input>`.
OVITO Pro additionally offers the :ref:`particles.modifiers.bin_and_reduce` modifier, which lets you
map a particle model onto a voxel grid to obtain a coarse-grained field representation of the model.

**Transfer field values**

The modifier option :guilabel:`Transfer other field values to surface` copies all field quantities defined on the input voxel grid over to the isosurface's mesh vertices.
You can then use the color mapping mode of the :ref:`visual_elements.surface_mesh` visual element to locally color the isosurface and visualize a secondary field quantity on the isosurface.
The field values at each isosurface vertex are computed from the input voxel data using trilinear interpolation.

.. _particles.modifiers.create_isosurface.smoothing:

**Surface smoothing**

The generated isosurface can optionally be smoothed using a mesh fairing algorithm to even out surface steps resulting from the discrete nature of the input voxel grid.
The :guilabel:`Smoothing level` parameter specifies the number of iterations of the smoothing algorithm to apply. A value of 0 disables smoothing, which is the default setting.
The post-processing procedure slightly displaces the surface mesh vertices to reduce steps and roughness of the isosurface.
Mesh smoothing is performed *after* interpolated field values have been transferred to the surface, which means that the surface property values reflect the
original vertex positions prior to smoothing.

.. _particles.modifiers.create_isosurface.regions:

**Identify volumetric regions** |ovito-pro|

This option lets the modifier identify the individual volumetric regions (below or above the iso-level), which are separated by the isosurface, and compute their respective volumes and surface areas.
See :ref:`particles.modifiers.construct_surface_mesh.regions` for more details on how this option works. This feature can be useful to analyze the topology of the isosurface and
to quantify the volume(s) enclosed by the surface.
