VASP POSCAR / XDATCAR / CHGCAR file reader

  User interface of the POSCAR file reader, which appears as part of a pipeline's :ref:`file source <scene_objects.file_source>`.

This file reader parses various file format variants written by the `VASP <https://www.vasp.at/>`__ simulation package.

OVITO can import atomic structures from `POSCAR` files, simulation trajectories from `XDATCAR` files,
and charge density fields from `CHGCAR` files. The file reader supports both the standard and the
direct format of `POSCAR` files.

.. note::

  To read the newer HDF5-based output files (``vaspout.h5``) written by recent VASP versions, use the
  :ref:`file_formats.input.vasp_hdf5` instead.

XDATCAR files
"""""""""""""

When you import a `XDATCAR` file, OVITO will display the trajectory as a sequence of frames in the animation timeline.
Important: This only works if the name of the file contains the string "XDATCAR". Otherwise, the file is treated as a single-frame `POSCAR` file.

CHGCAR files
""""""""""""

When you import a `CHGCAR` file, the charge density field is imported as a :ref:`voxel grid <scene_objects.voxel_grid>`
in addition to the :ref:`scene_objects.particles` structure, and OVITO will automatically insert the :ref:`particles.modifiers.create_isosurface` modifier
into the data pipeline to visualize the field as an isosurface. CHGCAR files are detected automatically
based on their contents.

For spin-polarized calculations, OVITO imports the total charge density (spin up + spin down) and the magnetization density (spin up - spin down)
as separate field properties of the same voxel grid.

For noncollinear calculations, OVITO reads the total charge density and the magnetization density. The latter gets stored
as a vectorial voxel field property with three components.

In all cases the field values loaded from the file get divided by the simulation cell volume during import.

Python parameters
"""""""""""""""""

The file reader accepts the following optional keyword parameters in a call to the :py:func:`~ovito.io.import_file` or :py:meth:`~ovito.pipeline.FileSource.load` Python functions.

.. py:function:: import_file(location, centering = False, generate_bonds = False)
  :noindex:

  :param centering: If ``True``, the simulation cell and atomic coordinates are translated to center the box at the coordinate origin.
                    If ``False``, one corner of the simulation cell remains fixed at the coordinate origin.
  :type centering: bool

  :param generate_bonds: Activates the generation of ad-hoc bonds connecting the atoms loaded from the file.
                         Ad-hoc bond generation is based on the van der Waals radii of the chemical elements.
                         Alternatively, you can apply the :py:class:`~ovito.modifiers.CreateBondsModifier` to the
                         system after import, which provides more control over the generation of pair-wise bonds.
  :type generate_bonds: bool

For `CHGCAR` files, field values are imported into a :py:class:`~ovito.data.VoxelGrid` object with identifier ``charge-density``
having one or more field properties:

  - ``Charge Density`` (total charge density)
  - ``Magnetization Density``
     - For spin-polarized calculations: Scalar magnetization density (spin up - spin down)
     - For noncollinear calculations: Magnetization density vector with three components ``X``, ``Y``, and ``Z``
