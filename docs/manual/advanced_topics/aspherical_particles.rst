   User-defined particle shapes

OVITO provides built-in support for various particle shapes beyond the default spherical shape:

 - :ref:`Spheres <howto.aspherical_particles.spheres>`
 - :ref:`Ellipsoids <howto.aspherical_particles.ellipsoids>`
 - :ref:`Superquadrics <howto.aspherical_particles.superquadrics>`
 - :ref:`Cubes and boxes <howto.aspherical_particles.boxes>`
 - :ref:`Cylinders <howto.aspherical_particles.cylinders>`
 - :ref:`Spherocylinders (capsules) <howto.aspherical_particles.capsules>`
 - :ref:`Circles and squares (billboards that follow the view direction) <howto.aspherical_particles.circles_and_squares>`
 - :ref:`User-defined polygonal meshes <howto.aspherical_particles.user_shapes>`

You can set the particle display shape for the entire system in the settings of the :ref:`Particles <visual_elements.particles>` visual element
or on a per-type basis using the :ref:`particles.modifiers.edit_types` modifier.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.orientation:

Controlling size and orientation of particles
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By assigning values to the following particle properties in OVITO, you can control the orientation and dimensions of
individual particles:

   - ``Radius`` (scalar)
   - ``Aspherical Shape`` (X, Y, Z)
   - ``Orientation`` (X, Y, Z, W)
   - ``Superquadric Roundness`` (Phi, Theta)

These properties can be assigned during data import by mapping corresponding file columns to the appropriate target properties in OVITO.
You can also modify them later by inserting the :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` modifier into the data pipeline.

The orientation of non-spherical particles is controlled by the ``Orientation`` property, which consists of four components:

.. math::

   \mathbf{q} = (x, y, z, w)

This represents a `quaternion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation>`__, a mathematical construct
used for three-dimensional rotations. Quaternions offer a more compact and numerically stable alternative to rotation matrices.

OVITO follows the quaternion notation established by `Ken Shoemake <https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/~frey/papers/scientific%20visualisation/Shoemake%20K.,%20Quaternions.pdf>`__.
This notation may differ from other conventions found in literature, such as the `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation>`__ format, where quaternion components are often written as:

.. math::

   (q_r, q_i, q_j, q_k) = (w', x', y', z')

Thus, when importing quaternion data into OVITO, ensure the correct mapping of input components.

The ``Orientation`` and ``Aspherical Shape`` properties are typically derived from simulation outputs.
For example, in `LAMMPS`, the following script commands dump and export per-particle orientation and size information:

::

  compute orient all property/atom quatw quati quatj quatk
  compute diameter all property/atom shapex shapey shapez
  dump 1 all custom 100 ellipsoid.dump id type x y z &
                                       c_orient[1] c_orient[2] c_orient[3] c_orient[4] &
                                       c_diameter[1] c_diameter[2] c_diameter[3]

When :ref:`importing the dump file into OVITO <file_formats.input.lammps_dump.property_mapping>`, ensure that the ``quati``, ``quatj``, ``quatk``, and ``quatw`` attributes are correctly mapped to the
``Orientation.X``, ``Orientation.Y``, ``Orientation.Z``, and ``Orientation.W`` particle properties (in this exact order).

OVITO can automatically establish this mapping if the `column names in the LAMMPS dump file are properly assigned <https://docs.lammps.org/dump_modify.html>`__:

::

  dump_modify 1 colname c_orient[1] quatw colname c_orient[2] quati colname c_orient[3] quatj colname c_orient[4] quatk
  dump_modify 1 colname c_diameter[1] shapex colname c_diameter[2] shapey colname c_diameter[3] shapez

Similarly, the ``shapex``, ``shapey``, and ``shapez`` columns will be mapped to ``Aspherical Shape.X``, ``Aspherical Shape.Y``, and ``Aspherical Shape.Z``,
which define the principal semi-axes of non-spherical particles as described below.

.. note::

   OVITO can automatically set up the correct mapping only if dump file column names are assigned as described :ref:`here <file_formats.input.lammps_dump.property_mapping>`.
   Otherwise, you may need to adjust the mapping manually in the :guilabel:`Edit column mapping` dialog, accessible from the :ref:`File import panel <file_formats.input.lammps_dump>`.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.spheres:

Spheres
"""""""

.. image:: /images/howtos/spherical_particles.jpg
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

The `sphere <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere>`__ particle shape is defined by the mathematical equation

  :math:`{\displaystyle {\frac {x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{r^2}} = 1}`.

The sphere radius :math:`r` is controlled by the per-particle property ``Radius``. If not present, the radius is determined by the
:ref:`particle type <scene_objects.particle_types>` or, globally, by the :ref:`Particles <visual_elements.particles>` visual element.

The ``Position`` particle property specifies an additional translation of the spherical equation above away from the coordinate system origin.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.ellipsoids:

Ellipsoids
""""""""""

.. image:: /images/howtos/ellipsoid_particles_example1.*
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

The `ellipsoid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid>`__ particle shape is defined by the equation

  :math:`{\displaystyle {\frac {x^2}{a^2}}+{\frac {y^2}{b^2}}+{\frac {z^2}{c^2}} = 1}`.

The lengths of the principal semi-axes :math:`a`, :math:`b`, :math:`c` of the ellipsoid are controlled by the per-particle property ``Aspherical Shape``,
which has three components `X`, `Y`, and `Z` (all positive). If all three components of the property are zero for a particle,
OVITO falls back to :math:`a=b=c=r`, with :math:`r` being the spherical radius of the particle as defined above.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.superquadrics:

Superquadrics
"""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/howtos/superquadrics.jpg
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

The shape of `superquadric <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superquadrics>`__ particles is defined by the equation

  :math:`{\displaystyle \left( {\left| \frac{x}{a} \right| ^{(2/\phi)}} + {\left| \frac{y}{b} \right| ^{(2/\phi)}} \right) ^{(\phi/\theta)} + {\left| \frac{z}{c} \right| ^{(2/\theta)}} = 1}`.

Like ellipsoidal particles, the superquadric shape has three semi-axes :math:`a`, :math:`b`, :math:`c`, which are specified by
the ``Aspherical Shape`` particle property. The two parameters :math:`\phi` and :math:`\theta` are called *east-west* and *north-south* exponents and determine
the blockiness/roundness of the superquadric ellipsoid. Both must be strictly positive. The normal sphere (or ellipsoid) is reproduced by setting :math:`\phi = \theta = 1`.
In OVITO, the values of :math:`\phi` and :math:`\theta` are specified by the ``Superquadric Roundness`` property, which is a vector particle property having two components.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.boxes:

Boxes
"""""

.. image:: /images/howtos/box_particles_example1.*
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

The size of box-shaped particles is given by the semi-axes :math:`a`, :math:`b`, :math:`c`, which are multiplied by a factor of two to yield the edge lengths of the box along the
Cartesian coordinate axes. In OVITO, the semi-axes are determined by the particle property ``Aspherical Shape``, which has three components.
If not present, or if the components of ``Aspherical Shape`` are zero for a particle, OVITO falls back to using the ``Radius`` particle property and renders a cube.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.cylinders:

Cylinders
"""""""""

The cylindrical shape is given by the radius :math:`r` and the height :math:`h` (in the local coordinate system of the cylinder). The natural orientation of the cylinder is along the positive z-axis,
with an optional rotation specified by the ``Orientation`` particle property. :math:`r` and :math:`h` are determined by the particle property components ``Aspherical Shape.X`` and ``Aspherical Shape.Z``.
The second vector component (`Y`) is ignored. If ``Aspherical Shape`` is not defined, OVITO will fall back to :math:`h = 2 r`, with :math:`r` taken from the ``Radius`` property instead.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.capsules:

Spherocylinders (capsules)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/howtos/spherocylinder_particles_example1.*
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

The size of spherocylindrical particles is controlled in the same way as cylindrical particles. OVITO additionally renders two hemispheres at each end of the cylinder, extending its height.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.circles_and_squares:

Circles and squares
"""""""""""""""""""

Circles and squares are two-dimensional, i.e., flat, shapes, whose size is controlled by the ``Radius`` particle property. The orientation
of each particle in three-dimensional space is determined automatically such that it exactly faces the viewer. Thus, their orientations are view-dependent,
and the ``Orientation`` particle property, if present, is ignored. In other words, you don't have the possibility to control their orientations explicitly
(use a mesh-based shape instead if you need control).

.. note::

  Flat circles and squares are not supported by the :ref:`rendering.tachyon_renderer`.

.. _howto.aspherical_particles.user_shapes:

User-defined shapes
"""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/howtos/particles_usershape_example.jpg
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

On the level of individual particle types, you can assign custom particle shapes imported from external geometry files.
OVITO supports loading general polyhedral meshes, which can serve as user-defined particle shapes, from various :ref:`file input formats <file_formats.input>`
such as STL, OBJ, or VTK/VTP.

Some simulation formats such as HOOMD/GSD can embed information on particle shapes directly in the simulation output file, which will be :ref:`picked up by OVITO automatically <file_formats.input.gsd>`.
In most cases, however, you'll have to load the user-defined particle shape by hand for each particle type in the :ref:`Particle types <scene_objects.particle_types>` panel.
Set the particle type's :guilabel:`Shape` to `Mesh/User-defined` and import the shape geometry from a file that you have prepared outside of OVITO.

The vertex coordinates of the loaded polyhedral mesh get scaled by the value of the ``Radius`` property of each particle (if present)
and rotated by the quaternion stored in the ``Orientation`` property (if present). Alternatively, you can set the
:guilabel:`Display radius` parameter of the type to scale all particles of that type or adjust the :guilabel:`Radius scaling factor`
in the :ref:`Particles <visual_elements.particles>` visual element to scale all particles uniformly.
