Rendering simulation trajectories on remote computers |ovito-pro|
=================================================================

.. versionadded:: 3.10.0

While setting up a visualization can be conveniently done with OVITO on a local desktop computer,
rendering a video of a longer simulation trajectory may be a time-consuming process -- especially if
the visualization involves costly data processing or computation steps. To speed up the
frame rendering process, *OVITO Pro* provides an easy way to offload the work onto a parallel
computing cluster.

.. tip::

   Make sure to also check out the :ref:`Remote rendering tutorial <tutorials.remote_rendering>`
   for an in-depth example of how to use this program feature.

How it works
------------

The :menuselection:`Render on Remote Computer` function of *OVITO Pro* prepares
a file bundle for you that can be sent to a different computer, e.g. a parallel computing cluster,
and render the frames of a simulation video on many compute nodes. The visualization scene you have created
on your local computer is transferred as a :ref:`OVITO session state file <usage.saving_loading_scene>`,
which means all settings will be precisely preserved when the bundle is unpacked and run on the remote machine.

The generated file bundle contains the necessary job submission scripts and Conda environment files
to execute the rendering task on the remote computing cluster. The rendering job will be performed by an
auto-generated Python script, which uses the OVITO Python module to load the session state on the cluster
and render the animation frames. The script is designed to use multiple compute nodes in parallel
to distribute the rendering work and will combine the resulting frame sequence into a final video file at the end.

A typical visualization setup includes one or more external simulation data files, which you have imported into the
OVITO scene. Since these external data files are not part of the session state, they need to be bundled and transferred to the
remote machine as well -- unless the simulation data is already present on the computing cluster.
In that case, *OVITO Pro* provides the option to remap the local file paths to the correct remote paths on
the target machine.

Setting up the bundle export
----------------------------

To prepare remote rendering follow these steps in your local *OVITO Pro* instance:

.. image:: /images/rendering/remote_render_utility.jpg
  :width: 35%
  :align: right

#. Build and configure your visualization scene like you would do for producing a video locally. Select
   :ref:`settings <core.render_settings>` such as output video resolution, animation range, and rendering backend as usual.
   Notably, you do *not* need to specify any video output file path,
   as this will be handled automatically.

#. Go to the *Utilities* tab of the command panel and
   open the :guilabel:`Render On Remote Computer` utility.

#. Here, you can optionally configure the number of CPU cores per render task (i.e. threads per
   MPI process) by entering a number into the *CPU cores per task* field. A value of 0, or leaving the field empty, will let OVITO
   utilize all available cores on each compute node to render one frame at a time on each node. On the other hand,
   on a cluster node containing 96 cores, for example, setting *CPU cores per task* to 8 means that each node can spawn up to 12
   independent workers, rendering 12 images concurrently.

#. Use the :guilabel:`Choose...` button to select a local output
   directory for saving the bundle. Please note that this directory must be
   empty to avoid accidentally overwriting existing files.

   .. image:: /images/rendering/remote_render_dialog.*
      :width: 50%
      :align: right

#. Then click the :guilabel:`Start export...` button. This will open a dialog where you can
   find a list of all filesystem locations used in the current OVITO scene
   (column *Current path*). Paths starting with ``sftp://`` have been :ref:`loaded from a remote server <usage.import.remote>`,
   other paths point to the local filesystem. For each *current path*,
   you can either enter a new *remote target path* or check the *bundle data*
   option.

   - Remapping paths from a *current* to a *remote target path* is useful when
     the data files referenced in the current OVITO scene are already present on
     the remote machine where rendering is going to take place. For example, if the
     imported simulation trajectory was loaded locally from ``/Users/daniel/simulation_data/`` and
     a copy of data is stored on the remote server under ``/scratch/daniel/simulation_data/``,
     you can enter the latter path in the *Remote target path* column.

   - Alternatively, you can select *Bundle data*. In this case, *OVITO Pro* will
     collect all data files referenced in the local scene and copy them
     into the bundle directory, which is going to be transferred to the remote machine.
     Note that, if you decide to pack files :ref:`imported from a remote location <usage.import.remote>` (``sftp://`` URLs),
     they will first be downloaded to your local computer once you click :guilabel:`Export`.

#. Finally, click :guilabel:`Export` to start the bundling process.

Alternatively, you can click :guilabel:`Cancel` to save the settings you have made so far and close the
dialog without performing the bundle export now. The settings will be saved :ref:`along with the scene <usage.saving_loading_scene>`
so that you can come back later and resume the export process.

Transferring the bundle directory
---------------------------------

Once the bundle has been created on your local computer, you should transfer the complete directory to the target machine
using your favorite file transfer tool, e.g.
`scp <https://linux.die.net/man/1/scp>`__,
`FileZilla <https://filezilla-project.org/>`__,
`Cyberduck <https://cyberduck.io/>`__ , or
`WinSCP <https://winscp.net/eng/index.php>`__.

.. tip::

   We recommend copying the files to a fast scratch filesystem. Please refer to your computing center's
   documentation for additional information.

Executing the render job on the remote computer cluster
-------------------------------------------------------

To start the rendering task on the remote computer cluster, follow these steps:

#. Log in to the remote computer via SSH and change into the bundle directory.

#. Install or update the `Conda environment <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments>`__ using the
   ``remote_render_ovito.yml`` file provided in the bundle directory:

   - If you haven't created a Conda environment named
     ``remote_render_ovito`` yet, you can set it up by running the command:

     .. code-block:: bash

         conda env create -f remote_render_ovito.yml

   - If the environment already exists, it is recommended to update it based
     on the new ``remote_render_ovito.yml`` file that is part of the bundle
     to ensure that all required packages are installed:

     .. code-block:: bash

         conda env update -n remote_render_ovito -f remote_render_ovito.yml --prune

#. Open the file ``submit.sh.template``, which is a template for a job submission script, in a text editor.

   Assuming you use the `Slurm queuing manager <https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html>`__ on your cluster,
   this file already contains commands to activate the Conda
   environment, set required environment variables, and execute the rendering script on the compute nodes
   (via ``srun ...``).

   However, you still need to add all the ``#SBATCH`` settings required by your HPC environment to the top of the Slurm job script.
   Additionally, you might need to include specific ``module load ...`` directives before the
   ``conda activate remote_render_ovito`` command to ensure the Conda base system and Python are
   loaded.

#. Once you have filled in ``submit.sh.template``, rename the file to ``submit.sh``
   and submit it to your cluster's queuing system using the appropriate command, such as
   ``sbatch submit.sh``.

#. After the rendering job is complete, you can find all rendered images in the
   ``frames/`` subdirectory. Moreover, a video file named ``video.mp4`` will appear in
   the main bundle directory.

Additional notes and troubleshooting
------------------------------------

While the instructions provided above are designed to work in many HPC
cluster environments, they may not be a perfect fit for every situation. Here
are some common questions and answers to help you address potential issues:

**Which queuing systems are supported?**
    The provided job submission file (``submit.sh.template``) is tailored for use with `Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html>`__.
    If you are using a `flux-based <https://flux-framework.org/>`__ queuing system, you should be able to directly submit the ``flux run ...`` command found in
    ``submit.sh.template`` in your flux environment. For all other queuing systems, the
    ``submit.sh.template`` file needs to be adapted manually.

**What if the render job times out?**
    Simply resubmit the render job from the bundle directory. The rendering script will
    automatically detect which trajectory frames have already been rendered and will
    continue from where it left off.

**Which operating systems on the target machine are supported?**
    Remote rendering is currently only supported on Linux-based computer clusters.
    For preparing the bundle you can use *OVITO Pro* running on Linux, macOS, and Windows machines.

**Are other conda-like package managers supported?**
    Yes, the rendering process has also been tested with :program:`micromamba` and should
    work with :program:`miniconda` or :program:`anaconda` as well. Please note that if you choose to
    use a conda alternative, you will need to replace all instances of the
    :command:`conda` command.

**What should I do on computer clusters without internet access?**
    If your computer cluster lacks internet access, you can consider using
    `conda-pack <https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/>`__ to relocate the required Conda
    environment to your remote machine. This approach is untested and success is not
    guaranteed.

**How can I add missing packages to the conda environment?**
    During packaging, *OVITO Pro* attempts to identify all installed Python packages in your
    local environment -- to install them also in the remote environment in case they are needed by your
    visualization setup. However, in rare cases, OS or package version
    mismatches may occur or some packages may be missed. To resolve this, manually
    edit the ``remote_render_ovito.yml`` file and add the missing packages. If you
    encounter this issue frequently, please contact the OVITO developers.

**How can I test / debug the rendering process?**
   First, make sure you have created the Conda environment from the file ``remote_render_ovito.yml`` as described above.
   Then execute the following commands adopted from ``submit.sh.template`` on the target machine:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda activate remote_render_ovito
      export CONDA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/x86_64-conda-linux-gnu/sysroot/usr/lib
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
      mpirun flux start remote_render_task.py

   Note that ``srun`` has been replaced by ``mpirun`` to run the process on the local node. If you encounter any errors, you can append
   ``-v`` or ``-vv`` to the ``remote_render_task.py`` script to get additional output in the ``logs/``
   directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

      mpirun flux start remote_render_task.py -vv
