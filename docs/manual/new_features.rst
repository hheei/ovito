Version 3.16.1 (14-Sep-2026)
----------------------------

- |ovito-pro| The embedded terminal of the :ref:`data_inspector.coding_agent` panel now lets you :ref:`adjust its font size <data_inspector.coding_agent.terminal>`,
  which is useful on high-resolution displays, where the system's default fixed-width font can render very small.

- .. figure:: /images/new_features/color_legend_with_shapes.png
   :figwidth: 30%
   :align: right

   Color legend displaying the real shapes of particle types.

  The :ref:`viewport_layers.color_legend` can now display the real 3d shapes of the element types instead of generic
  colored boxes. For particle types, this renders the atomic spheres the way they appear in the 3d visualization,
  including their shapes, colors, and relative sizes. See :ref:`viewport_layers.color_legend.type_shapes`.
  The new behavior is the default for newly created legends.

- The :ref:`XYZ file reader <file_formats.input.xyz>` now provides the :guilabel:`Generate bonds` option, which lets it
  create :ref:`ad-hoc bonds <file_formats.input.xyz.bonds>` between the imported atoms based on their van der Waals radii.
  The option is turned off by default.

- The program packages for Linux now run on a bare system without installing any additional packages. Previously
  they required a set of system libraries -- among them the OpenGL, GLib, D-Bus and Vulkan runtime libraries --
  which are absent from minimal Linux distros and from HPC compute nodes, where users typically cannot install
  system packages. We fully removed the OpenGL and GLib dependencies, and the
  OVITO tarballs ship the font libraries, a font family for systems that have none installed, and Mesa's
  *lavapipe* software Vulkan driver. The software driver is used only on machines that provide no Vulkan driver
  of their own, so a system with a GPU continues to use its native driver; set ``OVITO_VULKAN_FALLBACK=0`` or
  ``=1`` to override that choice. Only the graphical user interface still requires the X client libraries of the
  target system. See :ref:`installation.troubleshooting.linux`.

- |ovito-python| The ``ovito`` Python module for Linux, installed with ``pip``, now imports on a bare system without
  installing any system packages. The wheel ships no Qt of its own -- it loads the Qt libraries of the *PySide6* package
  it depends on -- and
  that Qt is built with OpenGL, GLib and D-Bus support. Importing the module therefore used to require about a dozen
  system libraries that minimal installations and HPC compute nodes do not have. The wheel now carries copies of them
  and loads only those the machine does not provide itself, so a system with a graphics driver, fonts and a desktop
  continues to use its own libraries. See :ref:`pydoc:use_ovito_with_system_interpreter`.

  Rendering images still requires a Vulkan driver (can be software-based), which the wheel does not ship due to size constraints.
  If none is installed, OVITO now names the system package to install instead of reporting that no graphics driver was found.

  The Linux wheels are now tagged ``manylinux_2_34`` (glibc 2.34 or newer: RHEL 9, Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, openSUSE
  Leap 15.4 and later), which is the requirement of the *PySide6* wheels they depend on. The previous tag promised
  compatibility that the dependency could not honour, and ``pip`` responded by silently installing an outdated OVITO
  release on such systems rather than reporting a problem. On older distributions, use the :ref:`Python interpreter bundled with OVITO Pro <pydoc:ovitos_interpreter>` included in the *OVITO Pro*
  tarball or the :ref:`conda package <pydoc:installation.anaconda>` instead; both bring their own Qt and run on
  glibc 2.28 and newer -- and you don't need a Pro license to use them.

  We also fixed the ``ovito`` Python module failing to import with ``ImportError: libQt6Gui.so.6: cannot open
  shared object file`` when it and the *PySide6* package are installed into different directories.
  The module now locates the Qt libraries through the *PySide6* package itself rather than assuming the two sit side by side.

- |ovito-pro| The expiration notice of an :ref:`OVITO Pro license <license-management>` now lets you
  request a renewal offer without leaving the application. The :guilabel:`Request Renewal Offer` function opens a dialog
  listing exactly which information is transmitted to our sales team, asks for your consent, and reports whether the
  request has been received. The function is also available once the license has already expired, from the license activation dialog.

- A couple of minor changes:

  - The :guilabel:`Generate bonds` option of the file readers supporting it is now remembered across program sessions.
    Once you turn it on for a particular file format, it stays turned on for subsequent imports of that format.

  - The caption of the :ref:`viewport_layers.color_legend`, formerly named :guilabel:`Title`, has been renamed to
    :guilabel:`Caption` to distinguish it from the layer's name shown in the GUI.

  - The :ref:`pipeline editor <usage.modification_pipeline.pipeline_listbox>` now shows how many data elements a
    :ref:`particles.modifiers.manual_selection` modifier has currently selected, e.g. ``8 particles`` or ``2 bonds``,
    next to the modifier's title. Nothing is displayed while the selection set is empty.

  - The :ref:`particles.modifiers.delete_selected` modifier now reports the number of elements it has removed in the
    :ref:`pipeline editor <usage.modification_pipeline.pipeline_listbox>`, e.g. ``12 particles, 3 bonds``, listing each
    kind of data element the modifier has operated on. Previously, only the name of the element type was displayed.

  - Large element counts displayed in the user interface, for instance the structure counts of the
    :ref:`particles.modifiers.common_neighbor_analysis` and other structure identification modifiers, are now
    formatted with digit group separators to make them easier to read.

  - Fixed a bug affecting the modifiers that process the entire simulation trajectory, i.e.
    :ref:`particles.modifiers.unwrap_trajectories`, :ref:`particles.modifiers.time_series`,
    :ref:`particles.modifiers.time_averaging` and :ref:`particles.modifiers.generate_trajectory_lines`.
    When the upstream pipeline changed while such a modifier was still scanning the trajectory, the running
    computation was not stopped and kept writing to the results the newly started computation was building up.
    The :ref:`particles.modifiers.unwrap_trajectories` modifier, for instance, could count every crossing of a
    periodic cell boundary twice and displace the particles by twice the correct distance.

  - Fixed a bug in the deserialization of session state files, which could cause a parameter value to be lost when a
    class and one of its base classes both declared a parameter of the same name.

  - Fixed a crash of :py:meth:`Scene.save() <ovito.Scene.save>` occurring in the standalone Python module when
    saving a session state containing a default-constructed font.

  - |ovito-python| Support for Python 3.10, which reaches its end-of-life, has been dropped. The OVITO Python module now requires Python 3.11 or newer,
    and prebuilt packages are provided for Python 3.11 to 3.14 on all supported platforms.

  - |ovito-pro| The embedded Python interpreter has been upgraded to CPython 3.14 on all platforms.

  - The Linux packages no longer carry several libraries that nothing in them could load: an
    unused copy of OpenSSL 1.1, which was picked up alongside the OpenSSL 3 that OVITO actually
    uses, and ``libxcb-xinerama.so``, which the Qt 6 platform plugin stopped needing when it
    moved to XRandR. That takes about 8 MB off the program package and 7 MB off the Python wheel.

  - Updated third-party components: Qt 6.11.2, PySide6 6.11.2, boost 1.92.0, OpenSSL 3.5.8, libssh 0.11.5,
    FFmpeg 9.0.1, ANARI-SDK 0.16.0, VisRTX 26.09, NetCDF-C 4.10.1, pybind11 3.1.0, embedded Python interpreter - see :ref:`sbom`
    for full version information. Newly redistributed with the Linux packages: fontconfig 2.18.3 and GLib 2.88.3, both
    built from source; see :ref:`credits` for the licenses of all bundled components.

----------------------------
Version 3.16.0 (14-Aug-2026)
----------------------------

OVITO 3.16 is a major release built around two big changes: an :ref:`AI coding agent <data_inspector.coding_agent>` can now work *inside* your
running OVITO Pro session, and OVITO's real-time rendering engine has been rewritten from the ground up to
use the native graphics API of each platform. Beyond that, data elements can be annotated with text labels in
the 3d scene, the data model learns to store text, and new tools arrive for :ref:`charge density analysis <particles.modifiers.bader_charge_integration>`
and :ref:`VASP file import <file_formats.input.vasp_hdf5>`.

Text labels in the 3d scene
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

OVITO can now annotate the objects in your visualization with text. The new
:ref:`particles.modifiers.add_text_labels` modifier prints the value of a property next to every data element it
belongs to -- a chemical species, an atom name, a particle identifier, a structure type, a coordination number,
or anything computed by the :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` modifier. It works on particles, bonds,
lines, vectors, voxel grid cells, surface mesh vertices and faces, and on the rows of a
:ref:`data table <scene_objects.data_table>`, produced, e.g., by the :ref:`particles.modifiers.cluster_analysis` modifier.
A printf-style format string controls how numbers are turned into text and lets you append units or marker characters, e.g. ``%.2f eV``, and
there is an option that restricts the labels to the current selection -- if you want to annotate just a few elements of
interest in a large dataset.

  Labeling of atomic clusters

The appearance of the labels -- font, size, color, outline, background, and on which side of an element the
label sits -- is controlled by the accompanying :ref:`visual_elements.text_labels` visual element.

AI Agent |ovito-pro|
""""""""""""""""""""

The new :ref:`data_inspector.coding_agent` tab lets you connect your preferred AI coding agent -- *Claude Code*,
*GitHub Copilot CLI*, *OpenAI Codex*, *OpenCode*, or *Google Antigravity* -- to your running OVITO Pro session.
Your agent runs in a terminal docked right inside the OVITO main window and works on the very scene you are
looking at: it can build and inspect data pipelines, run Python code against your data, check pipelines for
errors, step through the trajectory, and take screenshots of the viewports to see the result of its own work.

.. image:: /images/data_inspector/coding_agent_session.png
  :width: 66%

The `ovito-mcp <https://pypi.org/project/ovito-mcp/>`__ PyPI package (``pip install ovito-mcp``) connects the agent to OVITO via the
`Model Context Protocol <https://modelcontextprotocol.io/>`__, and it additionally gives the agent full-text
search over OVITO's user manual and Python API reference -- so the agent works from OVITO's actual API instead
of guessing at it.

Because you and the agent share one session, this is a genuine two-way collaboration: take over the GUI at any
time, and the embedded agent simply continues from wherever you left off.

It also works the other way around: Use your favorite external coding agent and let it start OVITO Pro
when it needs it. The OVITO MCP server can either open a full GUI window that you watch -- and interact with -- while the agent works,
or stay entirely headless for pure data analysis and batch processing tasks that never need a GUI, see the example workflows below.

See :ref:`data_inspector.coding_agent.setup` for step-by-step setup instructions.

Describe your goal in plain language, and the agent runs the analysis and builds the view for you. The four
recorded sessions below show what that looks like in practice -- click a prompt to read the full walk-through.

A new real-time rendering engine
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/new_features/3-16-0_rhi-rendering-schematic.svg
  :width: 100%

OVITO's built-in rendering engine -- the one that draws the interactive viewports *and* produces your final
images -- has been rewritten from scratch in 3.16.0. Instead of OpenGL, it now speaks the native graphics API of each
platform through Qt's RHI abstraction layer: **Direct3D 12** on Windows, **Metal** on macOS, and **Vulkan**
on Linux. This unlocks modern GPU capabilities such as compute shaders, and it lets OVITO make far better
use of the hardware you already have:

- **Faster interactive viewports.** Depending on scene and hardware, frame rates improve by up to 2--5x for
  ball-and-stick models, up to 3.7x for ellipsoidal particles, and by an order of magnitude for superquadric
  particle shapes. Integrated GPUs benefit particularly strongly.
- **A responsive user interface.** All GPU work runs on a dedicated render thread, so the application stays
  interactive while frames are being drawn.
- **GPU selection on multi-GPU machines.** The :ref:`viewports.configure_graphics_dialog` dialog now offers a
  :guilabel:`GPU adapter` list showing all graphics devices detected by the driver, along with their type
  (integrated, discrete, or software).

|ovito-python| **Rendering on headless machines.** The new engine renders offscreen images with GPU acceleration
and *without* requiring a desktop session, display server, or X11/Wayland connection. Python scripts calling
:py:meth:`Viewport.render_image() <ovito.vis.Viewport.render_image>` therefore now work out of the box over an
SSH connection, on HPC compute nodes, and inside containers. On nodes with several GPUs, the
``OVITO_GPU_ADAPTER`` environment variable and the new
:py:meth:`StandardRenderer.available_adapters() <ovito.vis.StandardRenderer.available_adapters>` helper let you
pick the device.

|ovito-python| The *OpenGL renderer* has been renamed to the :ref:`rendering.standard_renderer`, and its Python
class is now :py:class:`~ovito.vis.StandardRenderer`. The old name ``OpenGLRenderer`` remains available as an
alias, and existing session state files continue to load unchanged.

.. note::

  On Linux, OVITO now requires a Vulkan loader and driver to be installed (on Ubuntu/Debian:
  ``sudo apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers``). Machines without a GPU -- headless servers, containers,
  or virtual machines -- can use Mesa's *lavapipe* software driver, which is part of the same package. In
  return, the previous requirement of an OpenGL 2.1 capable system is gone. See
  :ref:`installation.troubleshooting.linux` for details.

Post-processing effects for all rendering engines
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/rendering/postprocessing_effects_panel.png
  :width: 30%
  :align: right

The depth-aware outline effect is now implemented as a GPU compute pass operating on the finished image, which
means **every** rendering engine supports it alike -- including, new in this release, the |ovito-pro|
:ref:`rendering.tachyon_renderer`.

Accordingly, its settings have moved from the individual rendering engines to the :ref:`core.render_settings`
panel. They are no longer lost when you switch to a different rendering engine, and the interactive viewports
now preview the effect exactly as it will appear in the rendered image. Settings stored in files written by
earlier program versions are transferred automatically.

  Outlines in the interactive viewport

.. figure:: /images/rendering/visrtx_render_outlines.*
  :figwidth: 45%

  Outlines in the rendered image

- |ovito-pro| Fix: The :ref:`rendering.tachyon_renderer` rendered flat-shaded particles and cylinders as
  three-dimensional, shaded objects. They are now drawn as true 2D primitives and correctly depth-composited
  with the ray-traced geometry.
- |ovito-python| Breaking change: The ``outlines_enabled``, ``outlines_depth_from``, ``outlines_depth_to``,
  ``outlines_min_width``, ``outlines_max_width``, and ``outlines_color`` parameters have been removed from the
  renderer classes. They are now keyword arguments of
  :py:meth:`Viewport.render_image() <ovito.vis.Viewport.render_image>` and
  :py:meth:`Viewport.render_anim() <ovito.vis.Viewport.render_anim>`.
- |ovito-python| The viewport layers and visual elements that render text -- :py:class:`~ovito.vis.TextLabelOverlay`,
  :py:class:`~ovito.vis.CoordinateTripodOverlay`, :py:class:`~ovito.vis.ColorLegendOverlay`, and
  :py:class:`~ovito.vis.TextLabelsVis` -- have new
  ``font_family`` and ``font_style`` parameters, which replace the old ``font`` parameter. The latter exposed
  Qt's internal font description string, whose encoding is not stable across Qt versions. The ``font``
  parameter remains available for backward compatibility and now accepts and emits a normalized form of the
  string, but assigning a malformed description now raises a ``ValueError`` instead of being silently ignored.

Bader charge analysis |ovito-pro|
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The new :ref:`particles.modifiers.bader_charge_integration` modifier partitions a charge density field stored on
a :ref:`voxel grid <scene_objects.voxel_grid>` into Bader volumes and integrates over them. It outputs atomic
Bader charges and atomic volumes as new particle properties, a data table listing every identified Bader region,
and a per-voxel region labeling that lets you visualize the basins of attraction. A second field quantity, e.g.
a magnetization density, can be integrated over the same volumes.

The implementation follows the accurate and efficient *weight method* of Yu and Trinkle
(`J. Chem. Phys. 134, 064111 <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3553716>`__).

Text properties in the data model
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :ref:`data model of OVITO <usage.data_model>` has been extended to support properties of *string* data type --
in addition to the previously supported numeric properties and :ref:`typed properties <scene_objects.particle_types>`.
This allows storing atom names, labels, or other textual information per particle, and the PDB, CIF/mmCIF, MOL2,
GRO, and MedeA file readers now import the ``Atom Name`` property as real text.

The :ref:`particles.modifiers.expression_select` and :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` modifiers
understand :ref:`string comparisons <particles.modifiers.expression_select.string_properties>` and
:ref:`regular expression matching <particles.modifiers.expression_select.regex>` in expressions:

.. code-block:: none

  AtomName == "O1"              # exact match
  AtomName =~ /^N[12]$/         # regular expression: N1 or N2
  ParticleType =~ /^(Cu|Fe)$/   # patterns also work on type names

File I/O
""""""""

- New file reader: :ref:`file_formats.input.vasp_hdf5` for VASP's HDF5 files (``vaspout.h5`` and ``vaspwave.h5``).
  It imports the atomic structure, the simulation cell, the complete ion-dynamics trajectory (including
  variable-cell runs), velocities and forces, per-frame energies as global attributes, and charge and
  magnetization density fields as :ref:`voxel grids <scene_objects.voxel_grid>`.
- The :ref:`file_formats.input.pdb`, :ref:`file_formats.input.mol2`, and :ref:`file_formats.input.medea_sci` now
  support the :guilabel:`Sort particles by ID` option (``sort_particles`` Python parameter), which reorders the
  imported atoms by their numeric identifiers after loading.
- Removed POV-Ray scene exporter.

Modifier additions and changes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.remove_property` -- Discards one or more properties of particles, bonds,
  surface meshes, voxel grids, data tables, lines, or vectors. Useful, for example, to remove the ``Color``
  property in order to restore the default type-based coloring of particles.
- The *Select overlapping particles* modifier has been renamed to
  :ref:`particles.modifiers.find_overlapping_particles` and gained a new option to move overlapping particles to
  their mean position, which merges near-duplicate particles into a single representative position.
- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.grain_segmentation` modifier now computes the center of mass, the radius, and the
  radius of gyration of each grain and outputs them as additional columns of the grain list. The center of mass
  doubles as the anchor point for the :ref:`visual_elements.text_labels` visual element. Grains extending across
  periodic cell boundaries are unwrapped for these calculations.
- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.create_bonds` modifier has a new option :guilabel:`Discard existing bonds`
  (``discard_existing_bonds``), which deletes the bonds already present in the input -- for example the bonds
  loaded from a simulation file -- before the new bonds are created. It lets you recompute the bond topology
  of a structure from scratch with a single modifier instead of having to delete the existing bonds first.
- Added amine to the list of functional groups identified by the :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_order` modifier.
- Performance: Faster nearest-neighbor search thanks to a more cache-friendly kd-tree layout. This speeds up the
  :py:class:`~ovito.data.NearestNeighborFinder` Python class and every nearest-neighbor-based algorithm in OVITO,
  including adaptive :ref:`particles.modifiers.common_neighbor_analysis`,
  :ref:`particles.modifiers.polyhedral_template_matching`, and :ref:`particles.modifiers.create_bonds`.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

- Fix: :ref:`particles.modifiers.compute_property` modifier UI not showing the neighbor expression input field
  after newly inserting the modifier into the pipeline.
- Fix: :ref:`particles.modifiers.find_overlapping_particles` could pick different particles to keep on different
  platforms when several candidates were equally far apart.

----------------------------
Version 3.15.4 (29-Apr-2026)
----------------------------

- :ref:`file_formats.input.poscar`: Accept blank lines almost anywhere in a file.
- |ovito-pro| Restored support for :ref:`OpenSSH-based connection method to remote files via SFTP <usage.import.remote.openssh_connection_method>` on Windows. The workaround is to use the Cygwin/MSYS2 build of `sftp.exe` that ships with Git for Windows instead of the incompatible version that comes with Windows.
- Fixed the option to specify a filename pattern on the command line when launching OVITO, e.g., ``ovito 'data.*'``. The single quotes ensure that the glob pattern is resolved by OVITO rather than by the shell.
- Fixed a bug in rendering of selected bonds and line elements with the VisRTX renderer in the interactive viewports.
- Bug fix: Cancel buttons of *Animation Key Editor* dialog and *Configure Trajectory Playback* dialog do not restore original states.
- Bug fix: Quitting the application via CMD+Q shortcut while a file selection dialog is open lets OVITO crash on macOS.

----------------------------
Version 3.15.3 (15-Apr-2026)
----------------------------

- The new :menuselection:`File --> Recent Files` menu provides quick access to recently opened files and scenes.
- The pipelines list widget in the upper right corner of the OVITO window now provides a button to toggle the visibility of individual pipelines in all viewports.
- The redesigned modifier selector widget now supports keyboard input for quick item search: typing one or more characters highlights the first matching entry, and pressing :kbd:`Enter` adds it. This restores a UI behavior that was present before the redesigned selector widget was introduced in OVITO 3.15.0.
- The :ref:`application settings <application_settings.general>` now provide an option to switch from the operating system's file selection dialog to the Qt widget-based file selection dialog, which can be useful on certain platforms (e.g. Linux with older GNOME desktops) where the native file dialog may ignore the working directory set by OVITO and always start in the same default folder.
- Fixed a bug in rendering of bonds with :ref:`fractional bond orders <visual_elements.bonds.fractional>`.
- Fixed picking of bonds with bonds orders greater than 1 in the :ref:`particles.modifiers.manual_selection` modifier.

- The :ref:`visual_elements.surface_mesh` and :ref:`visual_elements.triangle_mesh` visual elements gained new options to control the width and color of wireframe lines
  rendered along mesh edges when the :guilabel:`Highlight mesh edges` option is enabled.
- :ref:`file_formats.input.cube`: Added new option :guilabel:`Convert density values from Bohr units to Angstroms`, which controls whether the grid values are converted from :math:`\text{bohr}^{-3}` units to :math:`\text{Å}^{-3}` (OVITO's internal units).
- Fixed a bug that incorrectly labeled the central N atom of a nitro group in the :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_order` modifier (reported `here <https://www.ovito.org/forum/topic/functional-group-bug>`__).
- Fixed the display of :ref:`bonds with bond order <visual_elements.bonds.fractional>` greater than 3 by clamping bond order values to the interval [0, 3].
- Breaking change in the :ref:`file_formats.input.poscar`: The CHGCAR :ref:`grid type <scene_objects.voxel_grid>` has been changed from *cell-data* to *point-data*. This new interpretation is consistent with the grid definition in the `VASP wiki <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/CHGCAR>`__.

Version 3.15.0 (03-Mar-2026)
----------------------------

OVITO 3.15 is a major release that brings powerful new modifiers for molecular modeling, a streamlined workflow for sharing and organizing modifiers, and broad improvements to file I/O, video rendering, and platform support.

Improved support for molecular structures
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.create_bonds` modifier gained a new :guilabel:`Covalent Radius` mode, which uses tabulated covalent radii to automatically determine bond cutoffs for each pair of chemical elements.

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_order` |ovito-pro| -- Automatically assigns bond orders (single, double, triple, aromatic) to molecular structures, enabling the visualization of double and triple bonds and the identification of functional groups.
  The :ref:`visual_elements.bonds` visual element gained the ability to render different bond orders with distinct visual styles:

  .. image:: /images/modifiers/bond_order_functional_groups.png
    :width: 28%

  |br|

Modifier additions and changes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.find_overlapping_particles` -- Detects and selects particles that overlap in space. Useful for cleaning up imported datasets or verifying simulation configurations.
- The former *Bond analysis* modifier has been split into two focused modifiers, :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_angle_distribution` and :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_length_distribution`, for clearer functionality.
- The former *Coordination analysis* modifier has been renamed to :ref:`particles.modifiers.radial_distribution_function` to better reflect its primary purpose.
- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.expand_selection` modifier now offers a :guilabel:`Molecule` mode, which expands the current selection to include all particles belonging to the same molecule(s) -- ideal for selecting entire molecules in complex systems.
- Several modifiers now support processing only one particular object instead of the entire class of objects (e.g. surface meshes): :ref:`particles.modifiers.affine_transformation`, :ref:`particles.modifiers.delete_selected`, :ref:`particles.modifiers.show_periodic_images`, and :ref:`particles.modifiers.slice`.
- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.assign_color` modifier now supports operating on :ref:`scene_objects.lines` objects.
- The value of the :ref:`particle radius scaling factor <visual_elements.particles>` is now remembered across program sessions.

Modifier snippets
"""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/usage/pipeline/export_modifiers_as_snippet_menu.png
   :width: 25%
   :align: right

You can now :ref:`export and import modifiers as text snippets <modifier_snippets>` via the context menu in the :ref:`pipeline editor <usage.modification_pipeline.pipeline_listbox>`.
This makes it easy to save your modifier sequences for later reuse, share them with colleagues, or transfer them between machines -- all through a simple copy-and-paste of a text string.

New workflow for editing particle types and the simulation cell
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: /images/new_features/removed_simcell_particletypes.jpg
   :width: 30%
   :align: right

- OVITO 3.15 removes the possibility to directly edit particle types and the simulation cell.
  The corresponding entries in the :ref:`pipeline editor <usage.modification_pipeline.pipeline_listbox>` have been removed, because they bypassed the :ref:`data pipeline system <usage.modification_pipeline>`
  leading to unexpected behavior and confusion. Instead, two new modifiers will take over this job in the future, ensuring a clear, reproducible workflow.

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.edit_simulation_cell` -- Provides a dedicated, undo-able way to modify the simulation cell geometry and boundary conditions within the data pipeline.
  The new modifier also provides a more focused alternative to the :ref:`particles.modifiers.affine_transformation` modifier, which was previously often used for cell modifications.

.. image:: /images/new_features/edit_types_modifier.jpg
   :width: 30%
   :align: right

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.edit_types` -- Lets you rename, recolor, and reshape particle, bond, or molecule types as a pipeline step, keeping type modifications visible and reproducible.
  For the first time, this modifier also provides a way to add and remove types, e.g., to introduce a new particle species in the dataset.

- The new :ref:`Types <data_inspector.types>` tab in the data inspector gives you a clear overview of all particle types, bond types, and other type classifications in your dataset:

  .. image:: /images/data_inspector/types_page.jpg
    :width: 66%

  Click the pencil button, which appears when you hover over a type entry, to open the :ref:`particles.modifiers.edit_types` modifier with the corresponding type pre-selected for editing.

Redesigned modifier selector
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- The modifier selector widget has been redesigned with improved usability and a structured layout, making it easier to find and add modifiers to your pipeline:

  .. image:: /images/new_features/new_modifier_picker.jpg
    :width: 65%

.. image:: /images/tutorials/voronoi_cell/voronoi_cell_final.png
   :width: 22%
   :align: right

New tutorial
""""""""""""

- :ref:`tutorials.voronoi_cell` -- A step-by-step guide to visualizing Voronoi cells and exploring the local atomic neighborhood using OVITO

Video rendering
"""""""""""""""

- OVITO now supports :ref:`external FFmpeg video encoding <application_settings.video_encoding>`, giving you access to modern high-compression codecs such as *H.264* and *H.265* for smaller file sizes and better video quality:

  .. image:: /images/app_settings/video_encoder_settings.png
    :width: 55%

- The :ref:`render settings panel <core.render_settings>` now displays a video duration estimate before rendering, which takes into account the number of trajectory frames and the configured playback frame rate:

  .. image:: /images/new_features/3-15-0_video_length_label.jpg
    :width: 30%

Chemical element themes
"""""""""""""""""""""""

- Customizable :ref:`particle color and radius themes <application_settings.particles.themes>` let you define your preferred visual defaults for chemical elements. Themes can now be exported and imported as JSON files, making it easy to share consistent visualization styles.
  We provide a theme for download that matches the color style of the VESTA atomistic visualization software.

  .. image:: /images/app_settings/particle_settings.png
    :width: 55%

File I/O improvements
"""""""""""""""""""""

- Added a file reader for `MOL/SDF files <https://discover.3ds.com/sites/default/files/2020-08/biovia_ctfileformats_2020.pdf>`__, commonly used for storing molecular structures in chemistry and drug discovery applications.
- CIF file reader: Automatic creation of multi-element particle types for **sites with partial occupancy** at identical positions.
- mmCIF file reader: Sequence IDs are now read as the particle property ``Sequence``.
- The :ref:`PDB file reader <file_formats.input.pdb>` now reads atom serial numbers as particle identifiers and ``CONECT`` records as bonds.
- MercuryDPM file reader: Support for reading particle orientations stored as Euler angles, which get automatically converted to quaternions.
- Aspherix file reader: Always create the ``Particle type`` property even if type information is missing in the file, allowing users to still assign custom particle shapes.
- Updated the *gemmi* library to version 0.7.3 for improved PDB/CIF/mmCIF file import.
- Reduced the typical size of :ref:`OVITO session state files <usage.saving_loading_scene>` for long trajectories.

Platform support
""""""""""""""""

- OVITO now runs natively on :ref:`Linux aarch64 <installation.requirements>` (ARM64 architecture).
- OVITO installers now include a :ref:`Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) <sbom>` documenting all third-party software components.

Interactive viewports
"""""""""""""""""""""

- |ovito-pro| The :ref:`VisRTX renderer <rendering.visrtx_renderer>` now uses progressive refinement rendering in interactive viewports, delivering a more responsive experience when working with complex scenes.
- Rendering issues in interactive viewports (e.g. exceeding the maximum number of particles supported by OpenGL) are now clearly indicated by an error icon.

Bug fixes
"""""""""

- |ovito-pro| Fixed the :ref:`particles.modifiers.find_rings` modifier not finding rings of size equal to the configured maximum ring size.
- |ovito-pro| Fixed the :ref:`particles.modifiers.find_rings` modifier reporting evenly sized rings in both directions.
- |ovito-pro| Fixed broken "partition by bond/particle selection" modes in the former *Bond analysis* modifier (now replaced by the new :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_angle_distribution` and :ref:`particles.modifiers.bond_length_distribution` modifiers).
- |ovito-pro| VisRTX renderer: Fixed visual artifacts at semi-transparent object edges when compositing on light backgrounds.
- |ovito-python| A warning is now issued when attempting to export an empty scene to a :ref:`glTF file <file_formats.output.gltf>` via :py:func:`~ovito.io.export_file`.
- Fixed the :ref:`PDB file reader's <file_formats.input.pdb>` :guilabel:`Generate bounding box` option not working.
- Fixed detection of desktop dark color theme on Linux due to missing DBus module in Qt framework.

----------------------------
Version 3.14.0 (21-Sep-2025)
----------------------------

- :ref:`Discrete color maps <particles.modifiers.color_coding>`: A discretized color map can now be enabled to visualize integer properties with distinct color bands:

  .. image:: /images/new_features/discrete_colormap_settings.jpg
    :width: 35%

  .. image:: /images/new_features/discrete_colormap_legend.jpg
    :width: 25%

  |br|

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.find_rings` |ovito-pro| - A high-performance algorithm to identify and visualize bond rings in molecular structures

  .. image:: /images/new_features/find_rings_example.jpg
    :width: 35%

  |br|

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.reduce_property` |ovito-pro|

  .. image:: /images/new_features/reduce_property.jpg
    :width: 30%
    :align: right

  Reduces a selected data property to a single value by applying a specified reduction operation over all data elements. For example, the modifier allows computing the sum of a property across all particles.

  The modifier offers the following reduction operations: `minimum`, `maximum`, `sum`, `non-zero count`, `mean`, `median`, `variance`, `standard deviation`, `argmin`, and `argmax`.

- New modifier: :ref:`particles.modifiers.difference_between_frames` |ovito-pro| - Computes the difference (delta) of a property between the current frame and a reference configuration. The reference configuration can be either fixed or relative to the current frame (time offset), enabling sliding-window difference calculations.

  The modifier can compute time differences for the following kinds of inputs:
    - Particle properties
    - Global attributes
    - Data tables
    - Voxel grid properties

- New :menuselection:`Request a feature` function available in the :menuselection:`Help` menu:

  .. image:: /images/new_features/request_a_feature.jpg
    :width: 50%

  Send us your ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements in OVITO.

- :ref:`particles.modifiers.radial_distribution_function` modifier:

  The modifier can now count the number of neighbors of different types separately, which is useful for analyzing the chemical composition of the local neighborhood. Furthermore, it allows selecting other type classifications for the calculation of partial RDFs.

- OVITO's timeline can now display timesteps of the MD simulation instead of animation frame numbers:

  .. figure:: /images/new_features/timeline_show_timesteps.jpg
    :figwidth: 100%

    Timestep display

  .. figure:: /images/new_features/timeline_show_structures.jpg
    :figwidth: 100%

    Structure names for :ref:`ASE databases <file_formats.input.ase_database>`

  The new option can be enabled in the :ref:`animation.animation_settings_dialog` dialog of OVITO.

- The :ref:`rendering.visrtx_renderer` |ovito-pro| now lets you choose between the `standard` and `physically-based` material:

  .. figure:: /images/rendering/visrtx_renderer_matte_material.*
    :figwidth: 24%

    Standard material

  .. figure:: /images/rendering/visrtx_renderer_metal_material_r30-m0.png
    :figwidth: 30%

    Physically-based material

  Furthermore, we added support for depth-of-field rendering (focal blur) effect to the VisRTX renderer.

- We've added a new color gradient to OVITO that resembles `ParaView's 'fast' color map <https://www.kitware.com/new-default-colormap-and-background-in-next-paraview-release/>`__:

  .. image:: /images/new_features/colormap_fast.jpg
    :width: 35%

  |br|

- The pipeline editor of OVITO now provides a new function for creating shared visual elements, allowing easy synchronization of visual settings across multiple objects:

  .. image:: /images/new_features/shared_visual_elements.png
    :width: 80%

  |br|

- When you import a file not containing simulation cell information, OVITO no longer generates an axis-aligned bounding box around the particles.
  That means, OVITO will operate without *any* simulation cell in such cases. However, we've added the :guilabel:`Generate bounding box if needed` option to the
  file reader settings, which allows you to restore the previous behavior if needed.

  .. image:: /images/new_features/file_reader_generate_bounding_box.jpg
    :width: 30%

  |br|

- :ref:`file_formats.input.lammps_data`: added support for atom styles `spin`, `sph`, `rheo`, `rheo/thermal`, and `bpm/sphere`.
- A redesigned pipeline status widget, which can now display the complete status text in a tooltip window during mouse hover.
- Fix: Missing last tick mark in the color legend overlay.
- Fix: Usage-based sorting of "Quick command search" list not working.
- Added file export function to *Surfaces* tab of the data inspector.
- Renamed export format "Table of Values" to "Table of Global Attributes" for clarity.
- Aspherix PVD file reader: reads simulation time as global attribute ``Time`` instead of ``Timestep``.

    :width: 50%
    :align: center

- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.histogram` modifier received a new option for selecting the bin **normalization mode**:

    1. **Absolute count**: Output the number of elements in each bin.
    2. **Relative frequency**: Normalize the bin counts to the total number of input elements. Useful for comparing histograms with different numbers of input elements.
    3. **Probability density**: Normalize the bin counts to the total number of input elements *and* the bin width. This option is useful for comparing histograms with different bin widths.

- |ovito-pro| The :ref:`rendering.ospray_renderer` and :ref:`rendering.visrtx_renderer` now can do volume renderings of
  :ref:`voxel grids <scene_objects.voxel_grid>`, which lets you visualize volumetric data such as electron density
  or coarse-grained particle property fields.
  For this, the :ref:`visual_elements.voxel_grid` visual element has been extended with a new *Volume* representation mode
  and an editor for the :ref:`opacity transfer function <visual_elements.voxel_grid.volume_parameters>`:

  .. image:: /images/visual_elements/voxel_grid_example_volume_with_transfer.png

    :width: 30%

- |ovito-pro| The :ref:`rendering.visrtx_renderer` now uses a physically-based shading model for scene objects,
  which also allows for more realistic rendering of materials with different surface properties (e.g. metallic materials).

  .. image:: /images/rendering/visrtx_renderer_metal_material_r60-m0.png
    :width: 30%

  .. image:: /images/rendering/visrtx_renderer_metal_material_r30-m0.png
    :width: 30%

- The :ref:`particles.modifiers.freeze_property` modifier can now gracefully handle :ref:`simulations with varying number of particles <particles.modifiers.freeze_property.varying_particle_numbers>`.

----------------------------

.. image:: /images/new_features/3-11-0_render-vectors.*
  :width: 40%
  :align: right

.. rubric:: Visualization of vector information

We've added the :ref:`Vectors <scene_objects.vectors>` object type to OVITO and the corresponding :py:class:`ovito.data.Vectors` Python class,
which allow placing arrow glyphs at arbitrary locations in 3d space (independent from particles) to visualize vectorial information anywhere.

.. image:: /images/scene_objects/vectors_ellipsoids_example.*
  :width: 30%

.. rubric:: Symmetric range option for color mapping tools

.. image:: /images/new_features/3-11-0_symmetric-colormap.*
  :width: 40%
  :align: right

The :ref:`particles.modifiers.color_coding` modifier and other color mapping tools can now maintain
a symmetric value range, which is useful for visualizing scalar fields that can take both positive and negative values.
If this option is enabled, the color mapping range is automatically centered around zero.

.. rubric:: Template system for :ref:`viewport layers <viewport_layers>`

Similar to :ref:`modifier templates <modifier_templates>`, you can now create pre-configured templates for :ref:`viewport layers <viewport_layers>` and reuse them in future program sessions.
This feature is particularly useful for creating consistent overlays across multiple visualizations.

.. rubric:: Interactive viewport rendering with VisRTX |ovito-pro|

On Windows and Linux machines with a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU, OVITO Pro now supports interactive rendering with the :ref:`high-performance VisRTX ray-tracing backend <rendering.visrtx_renderer>`.
This allows you to explore your data interactively in the viewports with high-fidelity rendering quality.

.. rubric:: Demo versions of the high-fidelity rendering backends in OVITO Basic

OVITO Basic now includes demo versions of the rendering backends :ref:`OSPRay <rendering.ospray_renderer>`,
:ref:`Tachyon <rendering.tachyon_renderer>`, and :ref:`VisRTX <rendering.visrtx_renderer>`.

.. image:: /images/modifiers/spatial_binning_example_dislocations.*
  :width: 40%
  :align: right

.. rubric:: Calculation of dislocation density and Nye tensor fields from DXA output |ovito-pro|

We've extended the :ref:`particles.modifiers.bin_and_reduce` modifier to compute the dislocation density field from the
output of the :ref:`DXA analysis <particles.modifiers.dislocation_analysis>`. The new option also supports calculating
the Nye tensor field from the discrete dislocation lines.

.. rubric:: Identification of dislocation core atoms |ovito-pro|

.. image:: /images/modifiers/dxa/dislocation_analysis_core_atoms_marked.*
  :width: 30%
  :align: right

We've developed a method for identifying atoms that are part of the defect core of individual dislocations.
This pro feature is now available in the :ref:`particles.modifiers.dislocation_analysis` modifier as a new option,
see :ref:`Identification of dislocation core atoms <particles.modifiers.dislocation_analysis.mark_core_atoms>`.

.. rubric:: Python code generator for complex pipeline architectures |ovito-pro|

The :ref:`Python code generator <python_code_generation>` now supports scenes containing multiple pipelines and can generate
valid script code for the most complex pipeline architectures, including branched pipelines, shared modifiers, and shared visual elements created with the interactive OVITO GUI.
It also got better at handling viewport layers in complex visualization setups.

.. rubric:: Further improvements in this program release:

- Major code refactoring to improve performance and maintainability; elimination of unnecessary data copies in the pipeline system
- Modifiers now keep their computed results in memory when being temporarily turned off by the user to avoid recomputation when reenabled again
- Better decoupling of UI and pipeline system, in particular to speed up the processing of long trajectories, which caused an unnecessary number of display updates in the past
- :ref:`particles.modifiers.generate_trajectory_lines` modifier: Trajectory processing now happens automatically in the background - it is no longer necessary to start the process manually
- :ref:`particles.modifiers.affine_transformation` modifier: Rotational transformations now act on the Burgers vectors of :ref:`dislocation lines <scene_objects.dislocations>`
- :ref:`particles.modifiers.dislocation_analysis` modifier: Ensure cross-platform reproducible output
- :ref:`particles.modifiers.unwrap_trajectories` modifier: Performance optimizations
- Added a notification dialog that is shown on application startup when new program updates become available
- Simulation file import: Updated mass of *Zn* in internal table of elements from 65.409 (pre 2007 value) to 65.38 (see https://www.ciaaw.org/zinc.htm) - old value is still recognized for compatibility reasons
- The Aspherix file reader can now load both *particle-particle* and *particle-wall* contact networks
- Added parser support for modern Aspherix *.vtm* files containing a "Bodies" section. Bodies information from non-convex particle simulations is read in as a :ref:`data table <scene_objects.data_table>`.

  .. figure:: /images/new_features/3-11-0_bodies-before.*
    :figwidth: 40%

    Each Aspherix DEM body is originally composed of multiple convex sub-particles.

  .. figure:: /images/new_features/3-11-0_bodies-after.*
    :figwidth: 40%

    A Python extension allows combining the sub-particles to non-convex body particles.

- Import of existing CA files (i.e. loading of precomputed :ref:`DXA results <particles.modifiers.dislocation_analysis.fileformat>`) is now an exclusive OVITO Pro program feature
- :ref:`particles.modifiers.slice` and :ref:`particles.modifiers.affine_transformation` modifiers: Step-wise parameter increments are now proportional to the simulation box size instead of the current parameter value to improve usability during :ref:`interactive adjustments <usage.spinner_widgets>`
- Trailing "_" in imported particle property names are now stripped to avoid possible conflicts with the :py:ref:`underscore notation <underscore_notation>` in the Python API
- Updated third-party components to latest versions: Python, OpenSSL, Qt, PySide6, Qwt
- |ovito-pro| :ref:`particles.modifiers.time_averaging` modifier: Added time-averaging of the simulation cell shape and new option to overwrite original values with average
- |ovito-pro| :ref:`rendering.ospray_renderer`: Added support for pseudo-color mapping
- |ovito-pro| :ref:`rendering.visrtx_renderer`: Improved rendering performance for scenes with large numbers of cubic, ellipsoidal, or superquadric particles
- |ovito-pro| Environment variable ``OVITO_SAFE_MODE=1`` can be set to effectively block execution of Python scripts embedded in *.ovito* session state files from untrusted sources
- |ovito-pro| Updated the standard code template in the :ref:`particles.modifiers.python_script` modifier to use the :ref:`writing_custom_modifiers.advanced_interface`

ssh features. See :ref:`usage.import.remote.openssh_connection_method` for further information.

.. rubric:: User-defined file format readers |ovito-pro|

This program release introduces a :ref:`programming interface for user-defined file readers <writing_custom_file_readers>`, which enables
you to develop parser functions for new file formats in Python. User-defined file readers are fully integrated into the
GUI of OVITO Pro and work seamlessly with the :py:func:`~ovito.io.import_file` function from the OVITO Python module.

.. rubric:: Discovery mechanism for Python extensions |ovito-pro|

Python extensions for OVITO Pro or the OVITO Python module (i.e. user-defined modifiers and file readers) can now be :ref:`packaged as Python modules <registering_custom_python_classes>`,
making it easier to deploy and install them (using :command:`pip install`). Custom extensions you've developed can be put under version control in a Git repo
and shared online with other OVITO users if desired -- we have set up the new `OVITO Extensions Directory <https://www.ovito.org/extensions/>`__ for that purpose.
After :ref:`easy installation on a user's computer <particles.modifiers.python_script.installing_extensions>`, OVITO Pro automatically discovers all extensions
and makes them available in the GUI.

.. rubric:: Identification of volumetric regions using the Gaussian density method |ovito-pro|

The :ref:`particles.modifiers.construct_surface_mesh` modifier's implementation of the :ref:`Gaussian density method <particles.modifiers.construct_surface_mesh.gaussian_density_method>`
has been extended to support the :ref:`identification of volumetric regions <particles.modifiers.construct_surface_mesh.regions>`, e.g. pores, cavities, and filled spatial regions.
Their respective surface areas and volumes are calculated and output by the modifier in tabulated form.

To make this possible, we have developed an extension to the `Marching Cubes algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes>`__ for isosurface construction, which provides
the capability to identify disconnected spatial regions separated by the surface mesh and compute their enclosed volumes -- of course with full support for periodic boundary conditions.

---------------------------
Version 3.8.0 (03-Mar-2023)
---------------------------

.. rubric:: Develop custom modifiers with extended capabilities |ovito-pro|

A newly devised programming interface enables you to write advanced modifier functions in Python that

  * access **more than one** frame of a simulation trajectory,
  * perform computations that involve data **from several input files**, or
  * need control over the **caching** of computational results.

Take simulation post-processing to the next level! Develop your own trajectory analysis algorithms
in Python, which are fully integrated into OVITO's pipeline system and the interactive interface of OVITO Pro.

.. code-block:: python

    class CalculateIncrementalDisplacementsModifier(ModifierInterface):
        def modify(self, data, frame, input_slots, **kwargs):
            next_frame = input_slots['upstream'].compute(frame + 1)
            displacements = next_frame.particles.positions - data.particles.positions

Have a look at our completely revised :ref:`introduction to user-defined modifiers <writing_custom_modifiers>`
and check out the new :ref:`advanced programming interface for user-defined modifiers <writing_custom_modifiers.advanced_interface>`.

.. rubric:: Improved color legends

OVITO can now render tick marks in :ref:`color mapping legends <viewport_layers.color_legend>` to label intermediate values.
Furthermore, the legend's title may be rotated by 90 degrees:

  :width: 12%

.. rubric:: File reader for ASE database files |ovito-pro|

Load atomic structures from database files of the `Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__ into OVITO.
The :ref:`new file reader <file_formats.input.ase_database>` lets you scroll through all structures in a database or pick specific structures
using a query string. Metadata associated with structures is made available in OVITO as :ref:`global attributes <usage.global_attributes>`.

.. image:: /images/new_features/ase_database_reader.gif
  :width: 60%

.. rubric:: New modifier: :ref:`modifiers.identify_fcc_planar_faults` |ovito-pro|

Easily identify different planar defect types, such as **stacking faults** and **coherent twin boundaries**, in face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals.
We have developed a powerful classification algorithm for hcp-like atoms that make up such planar defects:

.. image:: /images/new_features/planar_faults.jpg
  :width: 30%

.. rubric:: New modifier: :ref:`modifiers.render_lammps_regions` |ovito-pro|

Use this new tool to generate mesh-based representations of the parametric regions defined in your `LAMMPS <https://docs.lammps.org/>`__ simulation,
e.g., cylinders, spheres, or blocks, and visualize the boundaries of these spatial regions along with the particle model:

.. image:: /images/new_features/lammps_regions.png
  :width: 60%

.. rubric:: Spatial binning modifier: New unity input option |ovito-pro|

This options offers a shortcut for calculating particle density distributions, i.e. counting the particles per grid cell.
Previous versions required first defining an auxiliary particle property with a uniform value of 1 to calculate the number density:

.. image:: /images/new_features/spatial_binning.png
  :width: 60%

See :ref:`particles.modifiers.bin_and_reduce` modifier.

.. rubric:: Support for LAMMPS dump grid files

OVITO can now read and visualize the `new volumetric grid file format written by recent LAMMPS versions <https://docs.lammps.org/Howto_grid.html>`__
thanks to the newly added :ref:`file_formats.input.lammps_dump_grid`:

.. image:: /images/new_features/volumetric_grid_discrete.png
  :width: 25%

.. rubric:: Slice modifier on voxel grids

When you apply the :ref:`Slice <particles.modifiers.slice>` modifier to a voxel grid,
cell values now get copied to the mesh faces and interpolated field values to the mesh vertices of the generated cross-section.
This enables both discrete and interpolated visualizations of the field values along arbitrary planar cross-sections:

.. image:: /images/new_features/volumetric_grid_slice_discrete.png
  :width: 25%

.. image:: /images/new_features/volumetric_grid_slice_interpolated.png
  :width: 25%

See :ref:`particles.modifiers.slice` modifier and :ref:`scene_objects.voxel_grid`.

.. rubric:: Support for point-based volumetric grids

In addition to the classical *cell-based* voxel grids, OVITO now also supports *point-based* volumetric grids,
in which field values are associated with the grid points instead of the voxel cells. All functions in OVITO
that operate on grids, e.g. the :ref:`particles.modifiers.create_isosurface` modifier, also support periodic and
mixed boundary conditions.

.. image:: /images/io/voxel_grid_types.png
  :width: 30%

See :py:attr:`ovito.data.VoxelGrid.grid_type` and :ref:`file_formats.input.cube`.

.. rubric:: Load Trajectory modifier now supports removal of particles

Previously, the :ref:`particles.modifiers.load_trajectory` modifier required the trajectory file to contain coordinates for all particles
that were initially present in the topology dataset. The improved version of the modifier can now deal with particles disappearing in later frames of a trajectory, e.g.,
when particles get removed from the simulation over time.

.. rubric:: Further additions and changes in this program release:

* Added dark mode UI support for Linux platform.
* :ref:`particles.modifiers.correlation_function` modifier: Added support for 2d simulations.
* :ref:`particles.modifiers.wrap_at_periodic_boundaries` modifier: Added support for 2d simulations.

---------------------------
Version 2.6.1 (15-Nov-2015)
---------------------------

* Arrows can now be centered on particles, e.g. to visualize magnetic moments and other vector properties. Atomic force vectors and dipole vectors read from simulation files can now be directly visualized.

---------------------------
Version 2.6.0 (02-Nov-2015)
---------------------------

* Added the <a+c> dislocation type for HCP crystals to the Dislocation Analysis modifier.

* The modification pipeline editor now allows changing the application order of modifiers via drag and drop.
* Added the Dislocation Inspection utility, which lets you obtain further information about dislocation segments extracted by the Dislocation Analysis modifier.
* Added an introduction to OVITO's animation system to the manual, which explains how to animate parameters and the camera.
* The Compute Property modifier can now perform computations that take into account the local neighborhood of particles. For example, you can use this to average a quantity over spherical regions around each particle.
* The Wigner-Seitz analysis modifier can now break down the computed site occupancy number into per-type numbers. This makes it easier to identify antisite defects, for example.
* Viewports are no longer automatically zoomed to show everything when replacing the currently loaded dataset with a new one. This makes it easier to preserve the current view configuration when switching to a different simulation file.
* Fixed the assignment of dislocation lines that were loaded from a CrystalAnalysis file to Burgers vectors families. The CA file import was broken since version 2.4.4.
* Added a `bond-based` mode to the Common Neighbor Analysis modifier, which computes the CNA indices based on existing bonds between particles. The modifier also outputs the computed CNA bond indices as a new bond property. This enables, for example, analyses of disordered systems using the classical CNA.
* It is now possible to write you own modifiers in Python.
* Added a `Use only selected particles` option to the Common Neighbor Analysis and the Identify Diamond Structure modifiers, which allows identifying sub-lattices.
* Added the NearestNeighborFinder Python class, which can be used from Python scripts to find the N nearest neighbors of a particle.
* Python scripts can now access the dislocation lines extracted by the DislocationAnalysisModifier.
* Bug fix: Bond properties like the bond type are now updated when dangling bonds are removed due to deleted particles.
* Fixed bug in Atomic Strain modifier, which produced weird results when PBC flags of reference configuration do not match PBC flags of deformed configuration. Now PBC flags of deformed configuration always override the boundary conditions of the reference simulation cell.
* Fixed error in ovito.dataset.scene_nodes.__iter__() Python method.

This is going to replace the Javascript engine, which has been deprecated and will be removed in a future program version. Command line options to run old scripts have been renamed to –jsscript and –jsexec.
* New Voronoi analysis modifier, which can compute atomic volumes, coordination numbers and Voronoi indices.
* It's now possible to include the coordinate system tripod and a color legend in the rendered image.

* Fixed an issue in the Construct Surface Mesh modifier, which sometimes led to a program crash on Windows.

---------------------------
Version 2.2.0 (15-Dec-2013)
---------------------------

* The Construct Surface Mesh modifier has been added, which builds a polygonal mesh around a particle set.
* The Cluster Analysis modifier has been added, which decomposes a particle system into clusters.
* A new experimental visualization module has been added, which allows working with data generated by the Crystal Analysis Tool and the Dislocation Extraction Algorithm (DXA).
* The Coordination Analysis modifier can now export the computed radial distribution function to a text file.
* Added a new user option to the application settings dialog that allows turning off the restriction of the vertical camera rotation.
* Added the File->New Window menu item, which opens another OVITO window. This makes life easier on the Mac OS platform, where starting multiple instances of the application is difficult.
* The XYZ file exporter now writes particle type names instead of numeric type identifiers.
* Added help buttons to parameter panels, which open the corresponding page in the user manual.
* The manual is now included in every installation package. An internet connection is no longer necessary to access the manual.
* Fixed the rendering of particle markers.

---------------------------
Version 2.1.0 (15-Nov-2013)
---------------------------

* The Manual Selection modifier has been added, which allows selecting individual particles with the mouse in the viewports. With the “Fence selection” mode, a group of particles can be easily selected by drawing a closed path around it.
* OVITO is now able to display particles with cubic and square shape. This can be useful in visualizing large 2d lattice systems or Ising models.
* OVITO now gives the user the option to import more than one dataset into the same scene and display them side by side.
* A newly added VTK file importer allows reading triangle meshes to visualize geometric objects such as an indentor tip.
* Camera objects can be created through the viewport context menu. A viewport can be linked to a camera object to show the corresponding view.
* The OpenGL rendering code has been updated to better support older graphics cards and to improve compatibility with more graphics drivers.
* The Tachyon renderer now supports semi-transparent particles. The transparency is controlled through the “Transparency” particle property. Use, for instance, the Computer Property modifier to set this property for certain particles. Transparency values can range from 0 (=fully opaque) to 1 (=not visible). Note that the interactive OpenGL renderer does not support transparency yet. Thus, all particles will still appear fully opaque here.
* When importing a sequence of simulation snapshots, one can now configure the mapping of input frames to OVITO's internal animation frames. This allows generating output movies with fewer (or more) frames than the imported snapshot sequence. This feature is in preparation for a future camera animation system.
* The Mac OS version is now built against version 5.2 (beta) of the Qt library. This should fix a nasty UI bug on this platform (due to the old version of that library), which made text fields lose input focus.
* Fixed saving/loading of the gradient type selected in the Color Coding modifier.
* Fixed a program deadlock when dragging the time slider with the mouse after loading a file sequence from a remote location.

---------------------------
Version 2.0.3 (22-Oct-2013)
---------------------------

* Ported Tachyon raytracing renderer from old OVITO 1.1.0 release. This software-based rendering engine allows producing images with high-quality shading and ambient occlusion lighting.
* The Create Bonds modifier will automatically turn off the display of bonds when (accidentally?) creating a large number of bonds (1+ million), which would make the program freeze for at least several seconds.
* The Displacement Vectors modifier now supports relative reference frames, i.e., displacements can be calculated from two snapshots separated by a fixed time interval. Before this addition, the modifier could only compute displacements with respect to a fixed reference simulation snapshot.
* The Inspect Particle applet now lets one select multiple particles and can report distances and angles between particles.
* Added `Clear history` button to remote file import dialog.
* The POSCAR file exporter now writes the new file format, which includes atom type names.
