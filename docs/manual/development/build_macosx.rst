Building OVITO on macOS
=======================

Installing dependencies
-----------------------

See the :ref:`list of requirements <development.requirements>` and install the required build tools and third-party libraries. OVITO should be compiled with
Apple's clang C++ compiler shipping with Xcode. It's easiest to use `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`_ for installing many of the required dependencies.

After setting up MacPorts, run::

  sudo port install netcdf pzlib libssh boost cmake yasm

from the terminal to install the required dependencies of OVITO.
SQLite3 is part of the macOS system SDK (included with Xcode) and does not need to be installed separately.

Next, download and install `Qt 6 for Mac <https://www.qt.io/download/>`_.

Next, download the source code and build the shared version of the `ffmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`_ video encoding library (optional)::

  curl -O https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-4.2.8.tar.gz
  tar xzfv ffmpeg-4.2.8.tar.gz
  cd ffmpeg-4.2.8
  ./configure \
    --disable-network \
    --disable-programs \
    --disable-debug \
    --disable-doc \
    --disable-static \
    --enable-shared \
    --prefix=$HOME/ffmpeg
  make install

Downloading the source code
---------------------------

To download OVITO's source code into a new directory named :file:`ovito/` run::

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/hheei/ovito.git

Compiling OVITO
---------------

Within the source directory, create a build sub-directory and let CMake generate the Makefile::

  cd ovito
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=`echo $HOME/Qt/6.*.*/clang_64/` \
      -DFFMPEG_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/ffmpeg/include \
      -DFFMPEG_LIBRARY_DIR=$HOME/ffmpeg/lib \
      ..

Adjust the paths in the command above as needed.
If this step fails, or if you want to disable individual components of OVITO, you can now run :command:`ccmake .` to
open the CMake configuration program and make changes to the build settings.
Once you are done, build OVITO by running ::

  cmake --build . --parallel

If this step succeeds, you can run :command:`cmake --install .` to generate an app bundle in the :file:`ovito/install/` directory.
