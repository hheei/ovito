/**
 * \brief This utility class finds the *k* nearest neighbors of a particle or around some point in space.
 *        *k* is a positive integer.
 *
 * OVITO provides two facilities for finding the neighbors of particles: The CutoffNeighborFinder class, which
 * finds all neighbors within a certain cutoff radius, and the NearestNeighborFinder class, which finds
 * the *k* nearest neighbor of a particle, where *k* is some positive integer. Note that the cutoff-based neighbor finder
 * can return an unknown number of neighbor particles, while the nearest neighbor finder will return exactly
 * the requested number of nearest neighbors (ordered by increasing distance from the central particle).
 * Whether CutoffNeighborFinder or NearestNeighborFinder is the right choice depends on the application.
 *
 * After the NearestNeighborFinder has been initialized, one can find the nearest neighbors of some central
 * particle by constructing an instance of the NearestNeighborFinder::Query class. This is a light-weight class generates
 * the sorted list of nearest neighbors of a particle.
 *
 * The NearestNeighborFinder class takes into account periodic boundary conditions. With periodic boundary conditions,
 * a particle can be appear multiple times in the neighbor list of another particle. Note, however, that a different neighbor *vector* is
 * reported for each periodic image of a neighbor.
